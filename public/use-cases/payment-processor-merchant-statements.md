## What is a Merchant Statement?

For any business that accepts credit cards (via **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or **Square**), the **Merchant Statement** is the "Final Proof" of revenue. It records the total sales volume, the processing fees deducted, and—critically—the **Chargeback Rate** (the percentage of customers who disputed their payments).

These statements are the "Income Proof" for the digital economy. Lenders use them to approve business loans, and buyers use them to judge the health of a company during an acquisition. Fraud is rampant: owners often "edit" a statement to turn a $10,000 month into a $100,000 month, or to delete a high chargeback rate that would indicate a failing or fraudulent business. Verified hashes bind the **Net Payout, Chargeback Volume, and Merchant ID** to the processor's domain (e.g., `stripe.com` or `paypal.com`).

## Data Verified

Merchant ID, business legal name, statement ID, period date range, total gross sales, total net payouts, processing fee totals, chargeback/dispute count and dollar amount, refund volume, issuing bank ID, settlement date.

**Document Types:**
- **Monthly Revenue Summary:** The primary executive overview.
- **Transaction Log:** (Linked hash) the granular list of thousands of sales.
- **Chargeback Notification:** Proof of a specific disputed transaction.
- **1099-K Tax Form:** (Linked hash) for IRS revenue compliance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`stripe.com`, `paypal.com`, `square.com`) and the account standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Good Standing** — Statement matches the processor's original digital ledger.
- **High Risk Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The chargeback rate has recently spiked above 1.0%.
- **Amended Statement** — **ALERT:** A correction was issued for this period.
- **Account Restricted** — **CRITICAL:** The merchant has been banned from the platform for fraud.

## Second-Party Use

The **Merchant / Store Owner** benefits from verification.

**Business Loan Approval:** When applying for a "Merchant Cash Advance" or a bank loan, the owner provides the verified hash of their Stripe statement. The lender can instantly see **"VERIFIED NET: $42,250"** on their phone, removing the 3-day "Manual Bank Login" or "PDF Review" delay and getting the capital released today.

**Trust-Based Sourcing:** A small shop can show verified revenue hashes to a high-end supplier (e.g., Apple or Sony) to prove they have the sales volume to qualify for an "Authorized Dealer" wholesale account.

## Third-Party Use

**Business Brokers / Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** Before buying an e-commerce store for $500,000, the buyer scans the verified hashes of the last 12 months of statements. This ensure the "Revenue" isn't a fabrication, protecting the buyer from "Profit Padding" scams.

**Tax Authorities (IRS / VAT)**
**Income Audit:** Verifying that the "Gross Sales" reported on a business tax return match the verified payouts from the processor, reducing the need for intrusive manual audits.

**Commercial Landlords**
**Tenant Vetting:** Verifying the "Gross Receipts" of a restaurant or retail tenant to calculate percentage-rent payments required by the lease.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Profit" Fraud Problem**

- **Revenue Inflation:** Editing a "$4,000" month into a "$40,000" month on a PDF to get a bigger loan.
- **Chargeback Scrubbing:** Deleting the "Disputes" section of a statement to hide a failing product or service.
- **Payout Masking:** Changing the "Bank Account" listed on a statement to hide that the funds are actually being frozen for fraud.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Payment Facilitators (Stripe, Adyen).**
**Fintech Platforms (PayPal, Square).**
**Merchant Acquiring Banks.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Merchant trade volumes and customer dispute ratios are extremely sensitive competitive data. The hash MUST be salted and access restricted to authorized financial partners.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Stripe, a regulated payment processor, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified merchant statements and revenue settlement records.

```
✓ business.stripe.com/statement/verify — Issues verified payment processor merchant statements
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK payment service providers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Merchant statements are the "Vital Signs" of a business. By turning static summaries into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the lending and acquisition markets from the multi-billion dollar cost of revenue fraud and ensure that "Success" is a cryptographic fact.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the payment processor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (merchant ID, business name, period date range, statement ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the merchant statement and an audit trail tax authorities can inspect.
