## What is a VGM Declaration?

When a massive cargo ship is loaded, the captain needs to know exactly how heavy every container is. If the ship is "top-heavy" or unbalanced, it can capsize and sink in a storm.

The **Verified Gross Mass (VGM)** is the official weight certificate for a container. By international law (SOLAS), no container can be put on a ship without one.

Shippers often "Guess" the weight to save the $50 fee for a certified scale. This "Guesswork" has led to several high-profile shipwrecks. Verified hashes ensure that the weight on the paper matches the official scale record at the port.

Verified Gross Mass Certificate
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Container #:    MSKU-123456-7
Seal #:         MAE-998877
Booking #:      99228877
Date:           15 MAR 2026

VERIFIED GROSS MASS (VGM):                            24,550.00 KG

Shipper:        Global Furniture Exports, Ltd.
Method:         Method 1 (Weighing the entire container)

This declaration is made in accordance with the IMO SOLAS
Regulation VI/2. The signatory certifies that the mass has been
verified using calibrated and certified equipment.

## Data Verified

Container ID, Seal ID, Booking number, Verified Gross Mass (VGM) in KG/LB, weighing method (Method 1 vs Method 2), shipper name, scale operator ID, scale certification status, date of weighing.

**Document Types:**
- **SOLAS VGM Certificate:** Required for every container loaded onto a ship.
- **Detailed Packing List:** Listing contents of the container.
- **Intermodal Equipment Provider (IEP) Log:** For chassis weight reconciliation.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Shipper or Weighing Facility) and current weight status.

**Status Indications:**
- **VGM Confirmed** — Weight matches the official scale record.
- **Mismatch Alert** — **ALERT:** Port scale and Shipper VGM differ by > 500kg.
- **Superseded** — Container was re-weighted (e.g., after transshipment).
- **Void** — Scale found to be out of calibration.

## Second-Party Use

The **Shipper (Exporter)** benefits from verification.

**Vessel Loading:** Proving to the Carrier (e.g., Maersk or MSC) that the VGM is authentic. If the carrier suspects a fake weight, they will refuse to load the container, causing massive delays. A verified VGM hash prevents "Paper Rejections" at the terminal gate.

**Liability Protection:** In the event of a vessel accident (e.g., ship capsizing or losing containers), the shipper can prove they provided a cryptographically verified, accurate weight, defending against claims of "Overloading."

## Third-Party Use

**Ocean Carriers (Vessel Command)**
**Vessel Stability:** The Chief Officer uses VGM data to plan the ship's stability (stowage plan). Verification ensures the data isn't "guessed" or fabricated, preventing catastrophic capsizing events.

**Port Terminal Operators**
**Gate Verification:** Automated gate systems can scan the VGM hash on the driver's tablet/paper. If it verifies, the container is allowed into the stack. If not, it is sent to the "Trouble Parking" area.

**Marine Insurers**
**Risk Management:** Ensuring that the project cargo they are insuring was accurately weighed and packed, reducing the risk of cargo shifting during storms.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Guessing" Fraud Problem**

- **Weight Guessing:** Shippers writing a "Guess" on the paper to avoid the $50 cost of using a certified scale.
- **Misdeclaration:** Artificially lowering the weight on the paper to save on freight costs (since freight is often calculated by weight).
- **PDF Editing:** Changing the weight from 30,000kg to 20,000kg to meet the ship's maximum deck load limit.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Exporters / Shippers:** (Using Method 2 - adding up weights).
**Public Scale Facilities:** (Using Method 1 - weighing the whole truck).
**Logistics Platforms:** (INTTRA, GTNexus - who aggregate VGM data).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Ocean carriers and port operators issue VGM declarations required by international maritime safety conventions.

```
✓ vgm.maersk.com — Declares verified container gross mass
  ✓ imo.org — Sets global maritime safety standards
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the shipper's or weighing facility's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (container ID, VGM in kilograms, weighing method, weighing date, shipper name) — never cargo contents or consignee details — providing non-repudiation of weight and an audit trail for port authorities and maritime safety oversight.


## Competition vs. EDI Messaging (VERMAS)

| Feature | Live Verify | EDI VERMAS Message | Paper VGM Form |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Shipper. | **System-Bound.** Relies on the message not being corrupted. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Visibility** | **Visual.** The trucker can see it's verified. | **Invisible.** Happens between back-end systems. | **Visual.** |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the gate. | **None.** Driver has no access to EDI logs. | **Manual.** |
| **Connectivity** | **Strong.** Works via simple web URL. | **Fragile.** Requires heavy B2B EDI infrastructure. | **Offline.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Trucker Reality." While the big carriers use EDI, the individual trucker arriving at the terminal gate often carries a **Paper Folder** of documents. Live Verify turns that paper folder into a trusted digital portal, ensuring the gate clerk and the driver are seeing the same verified weight as the carrier's stability officer.
