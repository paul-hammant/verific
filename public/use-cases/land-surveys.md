## What is a Land Survey?

A **Land Survey** is the official "Map of Truth" for your property. It is created by a licensed professional who visits the site with high-precision GPS and lasers to mark the exact boundaries of your land.

It proves the "Dirt Integrity" of your investment:
1.  **Encroachments:** "Is my neighbor's fence 2 feet on my land?"
2.  **Easements:** "Exactly where is the city allowed to dig pipes on my property?"
3.  **Building Lines:** "Can I legally build this ADU or pool here?"

**"Boundary Fraud"** occurs when developers or shady sellers "edit" a survey PDF to hide an encroachment or to make a small lot look slightly larger to a buyer. A 2-foot error can lead to a $50,000 lawsuit. Verified hashes protect the **Surveyor's original coordinates and measurements**, ensuring the "Dirt" you are buying matches the paper.

## Data Verified

Property Lot/Block, Metes and Bounds strings, Specific Encroachment descriptions (e.g., "1.2' West"), Monument types (Iron Rod, Brass Cap), Surveyor license number, Elevation data (if included), Certification timestamp.

**Document Types:**
- **Boundary Plat:** The primary map of property lines.
- **ALTA/NSPS Survey:** The "Gold Standard" for commercial closings.
- **Elevation Certificate:** Proving height for flood insurance (FEMA).
- **As-Built Survey:** Proving a new building was placed correctly.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Surveying Firm) and the responder text.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Survey is authentic and matches the surveyor's field notes.
- **Amended** — A correction was issued (e.g., to fix a typo in a bearing).
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer survey of this property exists; this one is outdated.
- **Void** — Survey retracted due to professional error or fraud.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner / Seller** benefits from verification.

**Disclosure Integrity:** When selling a home, providing a "Verified Survey" to the buyer. This prevents the buyer from claiming "Non-Disclosure" later if they find an encroachment, as the verified survey clearly documented the fence or shed at the time of sale.

**Permit Speed:** Proving to the City Planning Dept that your "Setback Math" is verified by a licensed professional, allowing for instant approval of a pool or fence permit.

## Third-Party Use

**Title Insurance Underwriters**
**Risk Removal:** Title companies use surveys to remove the "Standard Survey Exception" from a policy. "Verified by Surveyor" ensures the paper isn't a "Photoshopped" copy designed to hide a title-blocking encroachment.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Asset Security:** Verifying that the home they are financing is actually located on the land described in the deed. This stops "Air Loan" fraud where a house is built on the wrong lot.

**Adjacent Neighbors**
**Boundary Peace:** If a neighbor disputes a new fence line, scanning the hash provides instant, authoritative proof of the surveyor's findings, often de-escalating neighborhood conflicts before they reach a lawyer.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Plat Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Encroachment Removal:** Editing a PDF to delete the text "Fence encroaches 2.0 feet" to make a title clean for a sale.
- **Odometer Fraud (Lot Size):** Changing "100.0 feet" to "105.0 feet" to make a lot look buildable when it isn't.
- **Stale Surveys:** Leaving a 1995 survey in a closing packet to hide that a neighbor built a massive garage on the property line in 2015.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Private Surveying Firms:** (The primary issuers).
**Municipal GIS Departments:** (In some jurisdictions).
**State Boards of Professional Land Surveying.**

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the surveyor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the survey.

## Competition vs. Digital Plat Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | County GIS Viewer | Paper Plat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Precision** | **High.** Binds to the specific PE seal. | **Low.** GIS maps are often "General" and not legally binding. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Text.** Protects measurements. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect the paper. | **Zero.** Easily edited. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **The Surveyor.** (Professional Liability). | **The County.** (Assessor data). | **The Ink.** |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the property corner. | **Difficult.** Hard to align GIS pins with physical dirt. | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Fence Line" reality. Neighbors and surveyors argue in backyards and driveways. They need a **zero-friction trust anchor** that works on the paper they are holding. Live Verify turns the **Static Map** into a live safety dashboard, making "Boundary Truth" a transparent fact at the exact point of the property line.

## Data Verified

Property address, legal description (Lot/Block/Subdivision), surveyor name/RPLS license, date of field work, boundary coordinates (metes and bounds), presence of encroachments (e.g., fences over line), total acreage, issuing surveying firm.

**Document Types:**
- **Boundary Survey (Plat Map):** The primary legal diagram.
- **Topographic Survey:** For elevation and grading design.
- **ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey:** The high-detail standard for commercial deals.
- **Elevation Certificate:** (Linked hash) for flood insurance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Surveying Firm or County Surveyor) and current record standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Survey matches the surveyor's official field notes and stamp.
- **Superseded** — A newer survey exists (e.g., after a lot-line adjustment).
- **In-Dispute** — Boundary markers challenged by a neighboring property.
- **Void** — Retracted due to mathematical error or un-calibrated equipment.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner / Developer** benefits from verification.

**Fence / Pool Construction:** Proving to a neighbor or a municipal inspector exactly where the property line is. A verified hash from the surveyor's domain prevents "Line Creep" disputes and reduces the chance of expensive "Fence Wars" or lawsuits.

**Title Clearance:** Providing a verified, non-alterable ALTA survey to a title insurance company to remove "Survey Exceptions" from a title policy, which is essential for a clean closing.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Collateral Integrity:** Verifying that the building being used as collateral is actually *inside* the property boundaries and doesn't encroach on a neighbor's land.

**Real Estate Attorneys**
**Due Diligence:** Instantly verifying that the "Plat Map" in the data room is the original, un-edited version from the licensed surveyor.

**Civil Engineers**
**Design Accuracy:** Ensuring that new utility or road designs are based on verified, non-falsified boundary data.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Line Shifting" Fraud Problem**

- **Boundary Tampering:** A property owner editing a PDF survey to move a line by 2 feet to make their lot look large enough for a specific building project.
- **Encroachment Erasure:** Deleting the surveyor's note that mentions "Neighbor's shed is 3 feet over the line" before selling the house.
- **Surveyor Impersonation:** Creating a fake survey using the name and seal of a local surveyor who never actually visited the site.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Registered Professional Land Surveyors (RPLS).**
**Civil Engineering & Surveying Firms.**
**County Surveyors / Recorders.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Surveyors measure land boundaries and create official survey documents.

```
✓ survey.example-surveyor.co.uk/verify — Conducts professional land surveys
  ✓ rics.org — Regulates UK chartered surveyors and valuers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the surveyor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the survey.

## Competition vs. Physical Iron Pins

| Feature | Live Verify | Iron Pins (In the Ground) | Scanned PDF / Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Surveyor. | **Physical.** Trust the iron. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Reliability** | **High.** Digital record can't be moved. | **Low.** Pins are often pulled out or moved by neighbors. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds every word. | **None.** No data on the pin. | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Very Slow.** Requires digging/metal detector. | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Pulled Pin" reality. Survey markers in the ground are notoriously unreliable—they are moved by construction, kids, or dishonest neighbors. Live Verify turns the **Paper Survey** into an immutable digital anchor, ensuring that the legal intent of the boundary remains clear even when the physical markers are gone.
