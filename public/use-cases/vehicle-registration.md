## What is Vehicle Registration?

Police officer, at your open car window: "License and registration, please."

You hand over your driver's license and a folded piece of paper from the glove box — or, increasingly, pull up your state's app on your phone. The officer walks back to the cruiser and types your plate number into NCIC. Five minutes pass. Ten. You sit there wondering if the registration you renewed online actually went through, or if the DMV website ate your payment again.

The registration card proves three things: this vehicle is legally allowed on public roads, it has valid insurance, and the registered owner is known to the state. But paper registration cards are trivially forgeable — a colour printer and five minutes. The strongest architecture is still the official state or operator system: DMV lookup, cruiser tools, parking-enforcement systems, insurer feeds, or issuer QR codes where they already exist.

Live Verify is more plausible as a complementary bridge when a relying party is forced to work from the visible card, temp tag, or windshield artifact itself and lacks direct access to the official system of record.

Several US states (Utah, Louisiana, Colorado) already issue digital vehicle registration accessible via mobile apps. A QR code on the digital card — or printed on the windshield sticker — is a natural fit for Live Verify's camera mode: point, scan, confirmed.

## Data Verified

Plate number, VIN, year/make/model, colour, registered owner name and address, registration expiration date, insurance status (insured/lapsed/uninsured), registration status (active/suspended/revoked), any holds or flags (stolen, impounded, emissions non-compliance).

**Document Types:**
- **Registration Card:** The paper or digital card kept in the vehicle.
- **Registration Sticker / Tab:** The plate sticker showing expiration month/year.
- **Temporary Registration / Transit Plate:** Paper plate for newly purchased vehicles (typically 30-90 days).
- **Fleet Registration:** Bulk registration for commercial fleets (e.g., IRP — International Registration Plan for interstate commercial vehicles).

## Verification Response

- **ACTIVE** — Registration is current, insurance verified, vehicle is legal to operate.
- **EXPIRED** — Registration has lapsed. Vehicle cannot legally be driven on public roads.
- **SUSPENDED** — Registration suspended (common reasons: lapsed insurance, unpaid tolls/tickets, failed emissions).
- **STOLEN** — Vehicle or plates reported stolen. **Critical safety response.**
- **IMPOUNDED** — Vehicle is currently impounded by law enforcement.
- **EMISSIONS_FAIL** — Vehicle failed emissions inspection; registration renewal blocked until resolved.
- **404** — No matching record. Possible forgery, wrong state, or OCR error.

## Second-Party Use

The **Vehicle Owner** (second party) benefits from verification:

**Traffic Stops:** Instead of the officer walking back to the cruiser for five minutes, they scan the QR code and get immediate confirmation. Faster for the officer, less anxiety for the driver. In states with digital registration, the phone screen *is* the registration — no fumbling through the glove box.

**Proof of Insurance at Roadside:** Many states require proof of insurance during traffic stops. The registration verification can include insurance status, eliminating the separate "dig through your email for the insurance card PDF" step.

**Parking Disputes:** Proving to a parking authority that your registration was valid at the time a ticket was issued. The verification timestamp serves as evidence.

**Private Vehicle Sales:** Showing a buyer that the vehicle is currently registered, insured, and has no holds — before they commit to the purchase.

## Third-Party Use

**Police Officers (Roadside)**
Official law-enforcement systems should remain primary. Live Verify is more credible as a fallback for lower-capability contexts where the officer or verifier is working from the visible registration artifact and cannot easily reach the usual system.

**Parking Enforcement**
Parking wardens currently have handheld devices connected to municipal databases, but coverage is patchy and the devices are expensive. A phone camera scanning a windshield QR code gives the same information universally. Also useful for private parking operators (shopping centres, hospitals) who have no access to DMV databases.

**Toll Authorities**
Disputing a toll charge? The registration verification confirms the plate-to-owner mapping without requiring the toll authority to subpoena DMV records. Useful for resolving "that wasn't my car" disputes.

**Insurance Companies**
Verifying that a vehicle is currently registered (and in which state) when processing claims. Catches "garage" fraud — insuring a car at a suburban address for lower rates when it's actually garaged in the city.

**Used Car Buyers**
Before buying a car, confirming the registration is current, the seller is the registered owner, and there are no holds. Complements [Vehicle Title](view.html?doc=vehicle-titles) verification — title proves ownership, registration proves the car is currently road-legal.

**Fleet Managers**
Monitoring registration status across hundreds of vehicles. A single expired registration in a commercial fleet can result in an out-of-service order for the vehicle and fines for the company. Automated verification of QR codes on fleet registration cards catches lapses before enforcement does.

## Verification Architecture

**The Registration Fraud Problem**

- **Plate Cloning:** Copying a legitimate plate number onto a stolen or unregistered vehicle. The clone passes visual inspection (correct state, current sticker) but the VIN doesn't match the plate's registered vehicle. Live Verify returns the registered VIN — if it doesn't match the vehicle in front of you, the plates are cloned.
- **Sticker Theft / Forgery:** Peeling the registration sticker off a legitimately registered vehicle and putting it on an unregistered one. Or printing fake stickers. Common in states that use year/month sticker systems.
- **Insurance Lapse Concealment:** Registering a vehicle with valid insurance, then immediately cancelling the policy. The registration card still shows "insured" but the DMV record (with insurance company reporting) shows the lapse. Live Verify returns real-time insurance status.
- **Temp Tag Abuse:** Temporary paper plates (issued at dealers for newly purchased vehicles) are massively abused. Some states have reported hundreds of vehicles driving on the same temp tag number. Paper temps are trivially forged. A verifiable temp registration bound to the dealer's domain eliminates this.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State DMVs:** The sole issuing authority for vehicle registration within each US state (plus DC and territories).
**DVLA (UK):** Issues vehicle registration (V5C logbook) and tax disc (now digital).
**State/Provincial Transport Ministries:** (Canada, Australia, Germany, etc.)

**Privacy Salt:** Moderate. Plate numbers are visible on every parked car, so they're quasi-public. But linking a plate to an owner's name and address is sensitive. The salt prevents mass plate-to-owner enumeration while allowing verification when you have the actual registration document or QR code.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

State DMVs issue vehicle registrations under state motor vehicle codes. In the UK, the DVLA registers vehicles under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994.

**US (Texas):**

```
✓ dmv.texas.gov/reg/verify — Texas DMV vehicle registration service
  ✓ texas.gov — Texas state government
```

**UK:**

```
✓ dvla.gov.uk/reg/verify — DVLA vehicle registration service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## The QR Code Advantage

Traditional registration cards carry a `verify:` text line like any other Live Verify document. But vehicle registration is uniquely suited to QR codes because:

1. **Windshield visibility.** A QR code on the registration sticker or a windshield-mounted card can be scanned without the driver handing anything over — useful for parking enforcement, drive-through checkpoints, and reducing the tension of traffic stop interactions.
2. **Digital-first states.** Utah, Louisiana, Colorado, and others already issue digital registration via state apps. Adding a Live Verify QR code to the digital card is trivial — it's already on a screen.
3. **Temp tags.** Paper temporary plates are the single biggest registration fraud vector in the US. A QR code on the temp plate, bound to the issuing dealer's domain, would make every temp tag instantly verifiable. Texas alone has prosecuted dealers for issuing thousands of fraudulent temp tags.
4. **Fleet scale.** Fleet operators managing hundreds of registrations benefit from scannable QR codes during yard audits — walk down the line, scan each windshield, flag any expired or suspended registrations.

The camera-mode scan works identically to text-mode `verify:` lines — the QR code simply encodes the verification URL. In this domain, that matters because QR may actually be the better primary surface. Registration is a case where Live Verify should generally ride on top of issuer QR or direct lookup patterns rather than argue against them.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive DMVs' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (plate number, VIN, year/make/model, colour, registered owner name and address, registration expiration date, insurance status, registration status, any holds or flags) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the vehicle registration.

## Further Derivations

1. **Disabled Person Placards** — Proving legitimate parking rights. Placard fraud is endemic — people use deceased relatives' placards, borrow others', or forge them. A verifiable placard bound to the issuing authority's domain (and optionally to the holder's identity) would let parking enforcement scan and confirm legitimacy instantly.
