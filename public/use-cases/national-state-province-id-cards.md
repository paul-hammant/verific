## What is a National or State ID Card?

These cards are the core government identity credential for non-drivers, and in many countries they already sit inside a broader machine-readable ecosystem: barcode, chip, NFC, wallet, or issuer-operated identity apps.

That makes Live Verify a **complementary** tool here, not the dominant one. Its best case is when a human-readable card image or copy is being checked outside the native infrastructure. If a verifier already has NFC, a structured code, or direct access to the issuer's system, those remain the primary path.

## Data Verified

Full name, date of birth, residential address, unique ID number, sex, physical descriptors (Height/Eye Color), photo (via hash), document serial number, issuing authority, effective/expiration dates.

**Document Types:**
- **State/Provincial ID:** For non-drivers.
- **National ID Card:** Standard in many countries (e.g., EU, Singapore).
- **Public Service Card:** Proving eligibility for welfare/health services.
- **Tribal ID:** Issued by sovereign indigenous nations.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`mto.gov.on.ca`, `gov.uk`, `singpass.gov.sg`) and current identity standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Identity is verified and current in the government registry.
- **Stolen/Lost** — **ALERT:** Bearer has reported this physical card missing.
- **Superseded** — A newer ID card version exists for this person.
- **Revoked** — Identity credentials terminated (e.g., due to fraud discovery).

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Individual** benefits from verification.

**Age Verification:** Proving to a bouncer or retailer that their "July 20, 1985" birthdate isn't a "Fake ID" modification. Verification against the government domain removes the merchant's fear of "Underage Sales" fines.

**KYC Onboarding:** Proving their identity to an online bank or crypto exchange without needing to wait for a 24-hour "Manual Review" of a high-res photo. A verified hash allows for instant, cryptographic trust.

## Third-Party Use

**Hospitality / Alcohol Retailers**
**Bouncer Efficiency:** Instantly confirming that a "Novice Fake" ID isn't authentic. Standard fakes look perfect to the eye; Live Verify connects the bouncer directly to the government source in seconds.

**Landlords / Property Managers**
**Identity Vetting:** Ensuring that a rental applicant is exactly who they claim to be, reducing "Synthetic Identity" fraud in the housing market.

**Financial Institutions**
**Digital KYC:** Verifying the authenticity of a government ID during remote account opening, satisfying AML/CDD requirements without hardware scanners.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake ID" Fraud Problem**

- **Birthdate Tampering:** Minors using high-end printers to change their birth year on a valid ID to buy alcohol or enter venues.
- **Identity Theft:** Using a stolen ID but editing the name or photo on the card.
- **Status Faking:** Presenting a "Valid" paper ID for an identity that has been "Revoked" or "Flagged" by the government for fraud.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Ministries of Interior:** (e.g., in Germany, Spain, Singapore).
**State/Provincial Governments:** (e.g., Ontario, California, Texas).
**Tribal Authorities.**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. National identity data is the most sensitive data a government holds. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Mapping" of the population by hackers or foreign intelligence.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

National and state governments hold statutory authority under identity legislation to issue identity cards and verify citizen identity.

```
✓ gov.uk/identity/verify — Issues and verifies national identity cards
```

Self-authorized — this is a sovereign body whose authority derives from statute.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Photo Return: Defeating Sibling Lending and High-Grade Clones

Verification responses can include the **issuer's authoritative photo** of the credential holder — not just "valid/invalid" but the actual face on file.

**Why This Matters:**

| Attack | Without Photo Return | With Photo Return |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Sibling lending** | Bouncer squints at blurry card photo, waves through | Verification returns DMV's crisp photo — clear mismatch to person presenting |
| **High-grade clone** | Fake card with swapped photo, text hashes correctly | Text verifies, but returned photo doesn't match the face on the cloned card |

The cloner can perfectly replicate the card's text and even its holographic features. But they **cannot forge what the server sends back**. When the bouncer's phone displays the government's photo and it doesn't match the person in front of them, the fraud is exposed.

**The Doppelganger Attack (The "Woman in Cabin 10" Problem)**

Sophisticated fraudsters don't just clone cards — they search social media for facial lookalikes, recruit a doppelganger, then steal the victim's card details. The clone card shows the doppelganger's (similar) face, and when verified, the returned photo is "close enough" to pass casual inspection.

*This attack — finding lookalikes via social media facial matching — was dramatized in "The Woman in Cabin 10" (2025), where antagonists recruited a doppelganger to impersonate a billionaire.*

**Countermeasure: Geo-Anomaly Detection**

States can monitor verification request patterns:
- Card verified in London at 10am, then Los Angeles at 11am? Flagged.
- Card verified 50 times in one day across different venues? Flagged.
- Card verified in a jurisdiction 1,000 miles from holder's registered address repeatedly? Flagged.

Geo-checking won't stop a single clone use, but it detects systematic abuse and can trigger card revocation and investigation before major fraud occurs.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the government's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (ID number, issue date, expiration date, status) — never biometric data, address, or personal identity details — providing non-repudiation of the ID and an audit trail government agencies can inspect.


## Competition vs. NFC Chip Readers

| Feature | Live Verify | NFC (eID / Chip) | Scanned PDF / Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds photo to status. | **High.** Binds digital keys. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Gov. | **Key-Bound.** Trust the PKI. | **Visual.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Restricted.** Requires NFC-enabled phones. |
| **Adoption** | **High.** Works for cards without chips. | **Low.** Many US/Canada IDs lack chips. |

**Practical conclusion:** Where NFC or official digital-ID infrastructure exists, that should dominate. Live Verify is more defensible in the technology-gap cases where the verifier only has a visible card or an image and needs a lightweight bridge to current issuer status.
