## Data Verified

Importer name, Customs Entry Number, Warehouse Receipt Number, Class of Warehouse (1-11), inventory description, gross weight, declared value, bond reference, admission date, duty deferral status.

**Document Types:**
- **Warehouse Receipt (Form 214 equivalent):** Admission into the bond.
- **Withdrawal for Consumption (Form 7501):** Paying duty and exiting.
- **Withdrawal for Export:** Exiting to another country without paying domestic duty.
- **Transfer Document:** Moving goods between two bonded warehouses.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Warehouse Operator) and current cargo status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Admitted** — Goods are physically in the warehouse and under bond.
- **Released** — Customs duties paid; goods authorized for exit.
- **In-Transit** — Moving between bonded facilities.
- **Seized/Hold** — Customs has frozen the cargo (e.g., for investigation).

## Second-Party Use

The **Importer** benefits from verification.

**Trade Finance:** Proving to a bank that $2.5M worth of watches is "Verified in Custody" at a bonded warehouse. This allows the importer to use the cargo as collateral for a loan before the duties are even paid.

**Audit Compliance:** Providing a "Verified Admission Log" to Customs during an annual audit to prove that all deferred-duty goods are accounted for.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs Authorities (CBP / HMRC)**
**Inventory Control:** Customs officers can walk the warehouse floor and scan the paper receipts attached to pallets. "Verified by Warehouse System" ensures the importer hasn't "ghosted" the cargo (sold it without paying duty).

**Lenders / Banks**
**Asset Verification:** Verifying the "Bonded Status" ensures that the bank's collateral is being held in a regulated facility where it can't be legally moved without a Customs release.

**Cargo Insurers**
**Risk Monitoring:** Insurers can verify that high-value cargo is actually inside the high-security bonded zone and not sitting on an unmonitored loading dock.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Leakage" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Removals:** Physically removing goods from the warehouse to sell them domestically while keeping the "Admitted" paper receipt on an empty pallet to fool inspectors.
- **Value Swapping:** Admitting a box of "Luxury Watches" but re-writing the exit paper to read "Plastic Toys" to pay lower duties.
- **Fictitious Admissions:** Creating a fake warehouse receipt to trick a bank into giving a loan for cargo that doesn't exist.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Bonded Warehouse Operators:** (Class 3 Public, Class 4 Yard, etc.).
**Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) Operators.**
**Customs Brokers.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

HMRC administers bonded warehouse duty deferral and inventory control under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.

```
✓ customs.hmrc.gov.uk/bonded/verify — HMRC bonded warehouse duty deferral service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the customs authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the warehouse document.
## Competition vs. Customs ACE Portal

| Feature | Live Verify | ACE Portal (Gov) | Paper Receipt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any trucker/bank/auditor. | **Restricted.** Requires expensive "ACE Portal" credentials. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the Warehouse Operator. | **High.** Gov database. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Offline Proof** | **Strong.** The paper is the audit anchor. | **None.** Requires live gov system access. | **Medium.** |
| **Efficiency** | **Instant.** Scan the pallet tag. | **Slow.** Login, search entry #, find line item. | **Manual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Warehouse Floor" workflow. Customs inspectors and warehouse managers don't want to carry laptops and log into slow government portals while walking between rows of cargo. A self-verifying pallet tag provides the **immediate confirmation** needed for high-speed logistics and enforcement.
