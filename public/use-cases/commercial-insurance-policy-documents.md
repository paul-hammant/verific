## Data Verified

Insured name, policy numbers across multiple lines (GL, WC, Auto, Cyber), individual coverage limits, effective/expiration dates per line, deductible structures, endorsement presence (e.g., Additional Insured), issuing carriers (NAIC codes), Broker ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Evidence of Commercial Insurance:** The master summary for large clients.
- **Policy Declarations (Dec Pages):** The 1-2 page line-specific summaries.
- **Schedule of Forms:** (Linked hash) listing all 50+ endorsements in the file.
- **Premium Audit Report:** Proving the final adjusted cost.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Every policy in the summary is current and premium-paid
- **SEGMENT_LAPSED** — One specific line (e.g., Cyber) has lapsed; do not proceed without updated certificate
- **SUPERSEDED** — Mid-term changes occurred; request new evidence from insured
- **AUDIT_PENDING** — Policy active but final payroll figures unverified
- **EXPIRED** — Policy period has ended; do not rely on this certificate
- **404** — Certificate not found (never issued, revoked, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the certificate itself (e.g., `marsh.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, the response includes broker contact for follow-up:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

--- Certificate Information ---
Broker: Marsh McLennan
Contact: certificates@marsh.com
Request updated COI: https://marsh.com/coi-request/99228877
```

**Why This Pattern:**

Commercial insurance operates in a B2B context with established broker relationships. The verification confirms current status; any follow-up (endorsement requests, coverage questions, claims) flows through existing broker channels.

**For Segment Lapsed or Superseded:**

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: SEGMENT_LAPSED
Affected: Cyber Liability (AIG)

Action required: Request updated certificate from insured.
Broker contact: certificates@marsh.com
```

The verifier (GC, procurement team, lender) knows immediately which line has an issue and who to contact—without needing to make phone calls to figure out which carrier in a multi-line portfolio has the problem.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insured Business** benefits from verification.

**Master Service Agreement (MSA) Compliance:** Proving to a Fortune 500 client that the business has the complex, multi-layered insurance required by the contract. A verified "Portfolio Summary" prevents the client's procurement team from rejecting the vendor due to "Missing Endorsements."

**Credit Line Renewal:** Providing verified proof of total asset protection to a lender, ensuring the company's risk is properly mitigated before capital is released.

## Third-Party Use

**Enterprise Procurement / Vendor Teams**
**Continuous Monitoring:** Instead of manually checking 1,000 separate COIs every year, procurement software can scan the hashes. If a "Segment Cancelled" alert appears on a vendor's hash, the system automatically blocks their access to sensitive data or sites.

**General Contractors (GCs)**
**Site Compliance:** Verifying that a large subcontractor has all three mandatory lines (GL, WC, Auto) verified active before they move a crane onto the project.

**M&A Due Diligence**
**Legacy Audit:** Instantly verifying the "Retroactive Dates" and "Tail Coverage" of a target company's historical insurance portfolio.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Document Gaps" Fraud Problem**

- **Selective Deletion:** Editing a multi-line summary to hide that the "Cyber" policy was cancelled for poor security.
- **Ghost Endorsements:** Claiming a policy has a "Waiver of Subrogation" on the summary sheet when the underlying policy actually excludes it.
- **Limit Inflation:** Changing a $1M "Umbrella" limit to $10M to meet a high-stakes contract requirement.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Brokerages:** (Marsh, Aon, WTW).
**Multi-Line Carriers:** (Chubb, Travelers, Liberty Mutual).
**Compliance Risk Platforms:** (e.g., myCOI, CertFocus - hosting the hashes).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

AIG issues commercial insurance policies for UK businesses and organizations.

```
✓ commercial.aig.co.uk/verify — Issues commercial insurance policies
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, coverage limits, effective dates, endorsement list, insured entity name) — never claims history or loss details — providing non-repudiation of insurance coverage and an audit trail for lender and vendor verification.


## Competition vs. ACORD Data Feeds

| Feature | Live Verify | ACORD IVANS (Carrier Feed) | Scanned PDF Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works across all brokers/carriers. | **Limited.** Only for agencies on the IVANS network. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Endorsements*. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect the actual doc. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if cancelled *today*. | **Laggy.** Often 24-48 hours behind. | **Static.** |
| **User Control** | **High.** Business shares only the *Summary*. | **Low.** Lenders see full raw data. | **High.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Contractual Reality." Large businesses don't buy insurance from a single app; they buy through brokers who assemble a "Portfolio" from 5 different carriers. Live Verify turns that **Broker Summary** into a live digital anchor that provides "Single Source of Truth" trust for a complex, multi-carrier risk strategy.
