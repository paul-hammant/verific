## What are Purchase Orders and Delivery Notes?

In B2B commerce, the **Purchase Order (PO)** is the official offer to buy, and the **Delivery Note** (or Packing Slip) is the proof that the offer was fulfilled. Together with the invoice, they form the "Three-Way Match" required for corporate payments.

These documents are high-value targets for **Invoice Factoring Fraud**. A dishonest supplier might create a fake PO from a reputable company (like Apple or Walmart) to get a multimillion-dollar "Advance" from a bank. Similarly, a buyer might "alter" a delivery note to claim they received fewer items than were actually shipped. Verified hashes bind the **Order IDs, Quantities, and Unit Prices** to the issuer's domain (e.g., `amazon.com` or `boeing.com`).

## Data Verified

PO/Order number, buyer name, vendor name, item descriptions (SKUs), quantities, unit prices, total order value, ship-to address, delivery date, authorization signature ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Purchase Order (PO):** The initiating contract.
- **Delivery Note / Packing Slip:** Accompanies the physical goods.
- **Goods Received Note (GRN):** Signed by the buyer upon receipt.
- **Pro-Forma Invoice:** A preliminary bill used for customs/financing.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`acme-mfg.com`, `apple.com`, `ge.com`) and the order standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Open / Authorized** — Order is valid and awaiting fulfillment.
- **Partially Received** — Some items have been delivered and verified.
- **Closed / Fulfilled** — Order is completed; no further deliveries allowed.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** The buyer has revoked this order.

## Second-Party Use

The **Vendor (Seller)** benefits from verification.

**Production Confidence:** Before ordering $50,000 in raw materials to fulfill a big order, the vendor scans the buyer's PO. "Verified by Acme Corp" ensures they aren't working on a "Phantom Order" created by a rogue employee or a scammer.

**Speed of Payment:** By attaching a verified "Delivery Note" hash to their invoice, the vendor allows the buyer's system to perform an instant "Three-Way Match," reducing the payment cycle from 60 days to 5 days.

## Third-Party Use

**Banks and Factoring Firms**
**Financing Security:** A vendor asks for a loan against a $1M Purchase Order. The bank scans the PO. If the hash returns **"OPEN - ISSUED BY FORTUNE 500 CO,"** they can release the funds immediately. This eliminates "Fake Invoice" fraud, which costs the industry billions.

**External Auditors**
**Inventory Audit:** During a year-end audit, the accountant scans a random sample of "Goods Received Notes." Live Verify ensures the company isn't "Padding" its inventory with fake delivery paperwork.

**Customs and Tax Authorities (VAT/GST)**
**Trade Integrity:** Verifying that the value stated on the "Delivery Note" matches the price authorized on the "Purchase Order," preventing "Under-Invoicing" to evade import duties.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Profit" Fraud Problem**

- **Quantity Inflation:** Changing "10 units" to "100 units" on a packing slip to get paid for goods never shipped.
- **Price Padding:** Editing a PO to show a higher price than what was agreed.
- **Ghost Orders:** Creating a fake PO from a real company to use as collateral for a bank loan.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Corporate Procurement Portals (ERP).**
**EDI Gateways.**
**Government Purchasing Agencies.**

**Privacy Salt:** High. Corporate trade volumes and pricing are highly sensitive "Trade Secrets." The hash must be salted to prevent competitors from mapping a company's supply chain or pricing strategy.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues purchase orders and delivery notes

```
✓ procurement.example-corp.com/po/verify — Issues purchase orders and delivery notes
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

B2B commerce relies on "Document Chains." By turning each link in the chain (PO → Delivery → Invoice) into a verifiable digital bridge, we eliminate the friction and fraud that currently plague global supply chains.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the buyer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (PO number, quantities, order date, delivery status) — never pricing, supplier identity, or payment terms — providing non-repudiation of the purchase order and an audit trail auditors can inspect.
