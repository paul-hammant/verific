## What is a Geotechnical Report?

In the construction industry, the **Geotechnical (Soil) Report** is the "Structural DNA" of a project. It is a technical audit of the earth beneath a building. It defines critical engineering limits—such as **Bearing Capacity** (how much weight the soil can hold), **Liquefaction Risk** (will the ground turn to liquid in an earthquake?), and **Moisture Content**.

These reports are the foundation of all structural engineering. Fraud is high-stakes: a developer might "edit" a report to hide a landslide risk or to inflate the soil's bearing capacity to avoid the multi-million dollar cost of deep-foundation pylons. Verified hashes bind the **Borehole Data, Bearing Capacity, and Engineer's License** to the engineering firm's or the state's domain (e.g., `aecom.com` or `pe-registry.gov`).

## Data Verified

Project number, site address, parcel ID (APN), client name, engineering firm name, borehole count/depth, allowable soil bearing pressure (PSF), seismic site classification (A-F), liquefaction risk status, groundwater table depth, moisture content, licensed engineer name/license #, report date.

**Document Types:**
- **Geotechnical Summary Page:** The primary foundation design data.
- **Borehole Log:** (Linked hash) the raw data from the drilling rig.
- **Seismic Hazard Analysis:** Specialized risk report for earthquake zones.
- **Site Grading Plan:** (Linked hash) proving earthwork matches the report.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`aecom.com`, `jacobs.com`, `state-engineers-board.gov`) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Bound** — The report matches the original engineering audit.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer, more detailed report exists for this site.
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** The engineer has withdrawn the report (e.g., due to found errors).
- **Outdated** — **ALERT:** Report is more than 5 years old; soil conditions may have shifted.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Developer / Owner** benefits from verification.

**Bank Loan Draw:** Before releasing a $10M construction loan, the bank's structural auditor scans the geotechnical report. "Verified by Summit Geo" ensures the foundation design is safe and based on real data, protecting the developer from a future "Structural Default."

**Permit Approval Speed:** When submitting plans to the City Building Department, the developer provides the verified hash. The city's plan checker can instantly see **"VERIFIED BEARING: 3,500 PSF,"** bypassing the 2-week manual review of raw lab results and getting the "Shovel in the Ground" faster.

## Third-Party Use

**Structural Engineers**
**Design Integrity:** The engineer designing the building's steel skeleton scans the soil report hash. Verification ensures they aren't basing their life-safety calculations on a "Doctor'ed" report that hides soft clay or a high water table.

**Building Inspectors**
**Field Audit:** During a foundation-pour inspection, the city inspector scans the report hash. Live Verify ensures the contractor is digging to the "Verified Depth" required by the original engineer.

**Prospective Land Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** A buyer looking at a vacant hillside lot scans the verified reports from the past 10 years. This ensures they aren't buying a "Landslide Risk" that the seller is trying to hide with a clean-looking PDF.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Sinkhole Hiding" Fraud Problem**

- **Bearing Inflation:** Changing a "2,000 PSF" (Soft) rating to "4,000 PSF" (Hard) to use a cheaper, shallower foundation.
- **Risk Omission:** Manually removing a page from a PDF that warns of "High Liquefaction Potential."
- **Data Recycling:** Using a 20-year-old report for a different, nearby site to avoid the $15,000 cost of new drilling.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Licensed Geotechnical Engineering Firms.**
**State Professional Licensing Boards (P.E.).**
**Municipal Building Departments (as sub-issuers).**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Borehole data and project budgets are sensitive competitive information. The hash must be salted to prevent "Project Mapping" by rival developers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Engineers analyze soil and geotechnical conditions for construction projects.

```
✓ geotech.example-engineers.co.uk/verify — Conducts geotechnical and soil analysis
  ✓ engc.org.uk — Registers professional engineers in the UK
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Geotechnical reports are the "First Link" in the chain of structural safety. By turning technical summaries into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that the buildings where we live and work are standing on the digital truth of the earth, not the creative editing of a developer.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the engineering firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (project number, borehole count, bearing capacity, seismic classification, engineer license number, report date) — never plaintext or sensitive competitive information — providing non-repudiation of the geotechnical report.
