## What is a Rental Agreement?

A **Rental Agreement** (or Lease) is the foundational contract between a Landlord and a Tenant. It defines the "Rules of the Home"—the rent amount, the duration of the stay, and the safety deposits held in trust.

Beyond the relationship between the two parties, a lease is used by third parties as **Proof of Residence**:
1.  **School Enrollment:** Proving a child lives in a specific district.
2.  **DMV / Voter Registration:** Establishing legal residency in a state.
3.  **Lending:** A landlord using the lease to prove "Rental Income" to a bank when applying for a mortgage.

**"Lease Padding"** is a common financial fraud where a landlord "edits" a lease to show a higher rent (e.g., changing $1,500 to $2,500) to trick a bank into lending them more money. **"Fake Leases"** are also used by scammers to illegally occupy vacant homes or commit identity theft. Live Verify binds the **Tenant names, Rent amount, and Term dates** to the property management firm's or the landlord's domain.

**Why verification matters here:**

- **Lease padding inflates income to secure fraudulent loans.** A landlord applying for a mortgage on an investment property changes the lease from $1,500/month to $2,500/month, showing $12,000/year more rental income than exists. The lender approves a larger loan. When the actual rent cannot service the debt, the loan defaults.
- **Fake leases enable property occupation fraud.** A scammer creates a fake lease for a vacant property, changes the locks, and moves in — or sublets it to unsuspecting tenants who pay rent to someone who has no right to the property. The real owner discovers the fraud weeks or months later.
- **Tenants need proof of their lease terms too.** In disputes over rent increases, deposit amounts, or lease duration, the tenant needs to prove what was agreed. A verified hash of the original lease on the property management firm's domain is conclusive — no argument over which PDF is the "real" one.

## Data Verified

Landlord/Entity name, Tenant name(s), Premises Address (including Unit #), Monthly Rent amount, Security Deposit amount, Lease Start/End dates, Utility responsibility (e.g., "Water Included"), Signatory IDs.

**Document Types:**
- **Residential Lease Agreement:** The primary multi-page contract.
- **Lease Summary / Abstract:** A 1-page "Clip" for quick verification.
- **Notice of Renewal:** Extending the term of an existing lease.
- **Tenant Estoppel Certificate:** Proving lease terms to a building buyer.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Property Manager or Landlord) and the lease status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Lease is currently in effect; tenant is in good standing.
- **Terminated** — Lease has ended naturally or by mutual agreement.
- **Eviction Filing** — **ALERT:** Legal action is pending; lease may be void.
- **Renewed** — Superseded by a newer agreement (linked hash).

## Second-Party Use

The **Tenant** (second party) receives the lease agreement from the landlord or property manager (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the rental terms and their legal residence. Most of the time, the document sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the lease matches what the property manager's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If they need to prove residency for school enrollment, DMV registration, or dispute resolution, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the property manager.

## Third-Party Use

The tenant (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Mortgage Underwriters**
**Income Verification:** Before approving a loan for a landlord, the bank scans the leases for their other properties. "Verified by Mgmt-Co.com" ensure the rental income hasn't been "padded" to hide a high debt-to-income ratio.

**Renters' Insurance Carriers**
**Underwriting:** Verifying the address and the "Safety Features" (e.g., sprinkler requirements) listed in the lease before binding coverage.

**Government Agencies (DMV / SSA)**
**Residency Proof:** Using the verified hash to instantly validate a "Proof of Address" claim, reducing the risk of identity theft via forged residency documents.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Lease padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Rent Inflation:** A landlord changing a $1,200 lease to $2,200 on a PDF to qualify for a multi-million dollar building refinance.
- **Term Stretching:** Hiding that a lease is "Month-to-Month" and making it look like a "Fixed 2-Year" term to show income stability.
- **Occupancy Faking:** Creating a "Ghost Lease" for a vacant unit to make a building look 100% occupied to a buyer.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Property Management Firms (e.g., Greystar, Cushman & Wakefield)
- Independent Landlord Portals (e.g., Avail, Zillow Rental Manager - hosting the hashes)
- Legal Document Platforms (e.g., Rocket Lawyer, LegalZoom)

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Rental lease agreements contain many unpredictable variables that combine to create high entropy: unique agreement IDs, tenant names, specific property addresses including unit numbers, exact monthly rent amounts (including cents), security deposit amounts, and specific start/end dates. The combination of these unique identifiers makes brute-force enumeration infeasible without salt.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues residential property lease agreements

```
✓ lettings.example-agency.co.uk/verify — Issues residential property lease agreements
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the property manager's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (agreement ID, rent amount, lease start date, lease end date, property address, status) — never plaintext or tenant details like names or SSNs — providing non-repudiation of the lease terms.

## Competition vs. Scanned PDFs

| Feature | Live Verify | Scanned PDF / Paper | Digital Ledger (App) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Manager. | **Zero.** Easily forged. | **System-Bound.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Rent Amount.** Protects math. | **Vulnerable.** | **High.** |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Verifies only what's scanned. | **Low.** Exposes whole contract. | **Low.** Requires login. |
| **Field Use** | **Seamless.** Scan the paper at the DMV. | **Manual.** | **N/A.** |

**Why this remains strong:** Leases are routinely carried into school offices, DMVs, banks, and other places that do not have access to the landlord's or tenant's private portal. This is a strong portability case: the paper or PDF lease is the artifact in motion, and the verifier needs a lightweight bridge back to issuer truth.
