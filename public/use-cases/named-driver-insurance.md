## Data Verified

Policyholder name, specific Named Driver names, driver's license numbers (redacted), vehicle registration (License Plate), policy number, effective/expiration dates, coverage type (Comprehensive/3rd Party), issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Motor Insurance:** The primary legal proof in the UK/EU.
- **Named Driver Endorsement:** Proving an addition to a standard US policy.
- **Learner Driver Permit Insurance:** For supervised practice.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`admiral.com`, `directline.com`, `geico.com`) and real-time coverage status for the specific driver.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized** — The named driver is currently covered for the specified vehicle.
- **Excluded** — **ALERT:** This driver has been specifically removed from the policy.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated for all drivers.
- **Pending Payment** — Coverage active but subject to premium clearance.

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Driver** benefits from verification.

**Roadside Verification:** When stopped by police or involved in an accident, proving they are legally authorized to drive. Standard paper certificates are easily edited; a verified hash from the insurer provides "Court-Grade" trust that the person behind the wheel is actually on the policy.

**Rental / Car Sharing:** Proving to a car-share platform or a friend that they have verified liability coverage before borrowing a vehicle.

## Third-Party Use

**Law Enforcement (Roadside)**
**Frontline Enforcement:** Instantly confirming that a young driver hasn't been "added" to a parent's policy using Photoshop. "Verified by Admiral" stops "Fronting Fraud" where high-risk drivers hide on low-risk policies using fake paperwork.

**Car Owners (Lenders)**
**Risk Management:** A car owner can verify that a friend or family member is actually on their policy before handing over the keys for a weekend trip.

**Insurance Special Investigative Units (SIU)**
**Fraud Detection:** Identifying patterns of "Phantom Drivers" where policies are altered to add drivers only *after* an accident occurs.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Insurance Fronting" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Swapping:** A high-risk driver (e.g., a teen with a DUI) editing a parent's policy PDF to add their name as a "Named Driver" without the parent or insurer knowing.
- **Status Faking:** Showing an old "Active" paper for a driver who was excluded from the policy 3 months ago due to a bad driving record.
- **Buy and Cancel:** Printing a 1-year certificate, then cancelling the policy 2 days later.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Retail Auto Insurers.**
**Telematics Platforms:** (e.g., Root, Metromile - hosting live driver hashes).
**National Motor Insurance Databases:** (e.g., UK's MID).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Direct Line, a regulated motor insurer, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified named driver insurance certificates.

```
✓ nameddriver.directline.co.uk/verify — Issues verified named driver insurance certificates
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. National Databases (MID)

| Feature | Live Verify | MID / National DB (UK) | Paper Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Driver Specificity** | **High.** Verifies *who* is covered. | **Low.** Often only shows if the *car* is insured. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires specialized police terminal access. | **Instant.** |
| **User Access** | **Open.** Any citizen or car owner can verify. | **Restricted.** Usually only for Police/DVLA. | **Universal.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Driver Specificity" gap. Many national databases only track the *vehicle*. They don't list the 4 different named drivers. Live Verify allows a car owner to prove that a **specific person** is covered, which is the most common point of failure in car-accident liability disputes.
