## What is a PML Report?

A **Probable Maximum Loss (PML)** report is a "Scientific Guess" of how much money an insurance company could lose in a disaster.

A specialized firm (like RMS) uses weather data and building locations to say: "In a 1-in-100 year hurricane, you will likely lose $142 million."

This number is the lifeblood of the insurance market. Reinsurers use it to decide how much to charge for coverage. If a broker "Games the Model" (edits the PDF) to show a lower loss, they are tricking the market into taking too much risk for too little money.

## Data Verified

Modeling firm name, model version (e.g., RMS RiskLink 21), portfolio ID, number of locations, specific return period estimates (100yr, 250yr, 500yr PML), average annual loss (AAL), date of run, certification status.

**Document Types:**
- **PML Summary Report:** 1-2 page extract for underwriters.
- **Detailed Loss Analysis (DLA):** Full output file.
- **Exposure Data Audit:** Verification that the building data (COPE) is accurate.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`rms.com`, `air-worldwide.com`) and the report status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Model run matches the firm's official record.
- **Outdated** — Model version has been retired; new run required.
- **In-Dispute** — Exposure data (COPE) found to be inaccurate.
- **Invalid** — Serial number or parameters mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insurance Broker or REIT Manager** (second party) receives the PML report from the modeling firm (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the catastrophe model results. Most of the time, the document sits in their underwriting files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the PML figures match what the modeling firm's system recorded and haven't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If questions arise—whether from reinsurers, rating agencies, or investors—they have cryptographic proof of the model results ready without needing to contact the modeling firm.

## Third-Party Use

The broker or REIT manager (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Reinsurers**
**Capacity Allocation:** Reinsurers rely on these numbers to decide how much "Cat Limit" to deploy to a specific client. Verification prevents "Model Gaming" where a broker might manipulate parameters to show a lower PML and get a cheaper rate.

**Rating Agencies (S&P / Moody's)**
**Solvency Analysis:** Ensuring that the PMLs used in capital adequacy models are authentic and haven't been altered.

**Mortgage Lenders (Commercial)**
**Collateral Protection:** Banks lending on coastal towers verify the PML to ensure the project has enough insurance to survive a "1-in-500" event.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Model Gaming" Fraud Problem**

- **Parameter Tampering:** Manually editing the "Demand Surge" or "Storm Surge" flags in the PDF report to lower the PML by 20%.
- **Location Omission:** Deleting the most high-risk properties (e.g., Miami beach-front) from the portfolio run to artificially lower the aggregate loss number.
- **Fabricated Certificates:** Shady boutique firms claiming to use "RMS Models" but actually providing a guess-work estimate on fake letterhead.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Model Vendors (RMS, AIR Worldwide, CoreLogic)
- Actuarial Consultants (Guy Carpenter, Aon Benfield, Willis Re)
- In-House Modeling Units (For large carriers like Chubb)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Catastrophe modeling reports often contain enumerable values—round dollar amounts for PML estimates, standard return periods (100yr, 250yr, 500yr), publicly known portfolios, and model version numbers that are industry-wide. A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a rival's risk profile and gain unfair market intelligence. Salt protects these strategic risk assessments.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Actuaries model potential loss from natural disasters to quantify insurance risk.

```
✓ catmodel.rms.com/verify — Models catastrophe risk and insurance pricing
  ✓ frc.org.uk/actuaries — Regulates UK actuarial standards and practice
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the modeling firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (PML values, return periods, portfolio descriptions, model versions) — never plaintext (detailed location data, proprietary model parameters) — providing non-repudiation of the PML report.

## Competition vs. API Data Feeds

| Feature | Live Verify | API Integration | Scanned PDF Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Experience** | **Universal.** Scan the report in the "Submission Pack." | **Hard.** Requires complex software integration between Broker and Reinsurer. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Modeler. | **System-Bound.** Trust the data feed. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Works across 50+ different reinsurers. | **Low.** Every firm has a different platform (Touchstone vs RiskLink). | **Universal.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Seven-figure software licenses. | **None.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Market Cycle." In the high-speed "Renewal Season" (e.g., Jan 1), thousands of "Submission Packs" (PDFs) are emailed across the globe. Reinsurers don't have the time or tech to link APIs with every single broker. Live Verify provides **API-level trust** for the existing PDF-based workflow.
