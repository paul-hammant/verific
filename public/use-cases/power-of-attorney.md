## What is a Power of Attorney?

A **Power of Attorney (POA)** is a legal document that gives one person (the Agent or Attorney-in-Fact) the power to act on behalf of another (the Principal).

It is one of the most powerful—and dangerous—documents in law. It allows an agent to:
1.  **Empty Bank Accounts:** Withdraw cash and sell stocks.
2.  **Sell Real Estate:** Sign a deed to transfer a home.
3.  **Medical Decisions:** Decide whether to keep the principal on life support.

**"Elder Financial Abuse"** often starts with a forged POA. A criminal (or unscrupulous family member) creates a fake POA, gets a "lazy" notary to stamp it, and takes it to a bank. Verified hashes bind the **Principal's name and the specific powers granted** to the law firm's or notary's domain. A bank can instantly verify if the POA is authentic, current, and has not been **Revoked**.

## Data Verified

Principal name, Agent name, Specific Granted Powers (e.g., "Real Estate Only"), Effective Date, Durable vs. Springing status, Notary name/commission, Witness names, Law firm ID.

**Document Types:**
- **General Durable POA:** Full financial and legal control.
- **Limited/Special POA:** Specific powers for a single transaction (e.g., selling a car).
- **Medical POA (Healthcare Proxy):** Specifically for medical decisions.
- **Revocation of POA:** (Linked hash) proving the agent's power has been terminated.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Agent is currently authorized to act
- **REVOKED** — The principal has legally terminated this power; do not allow transactions
- **SUPERSEDED** — A newer POA has been issued; this version is outdated
- **VOID_DECEASED** — Principal has passed; POA is legally void; probate required
- **404** — POA not found (forged document, wrong reference, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the document itself (e.g., `willows-law.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

None typically. The verification confirms the POA's status; that's the decision point.

**Why No Further Action:**

- **Banks** just need status to allow or refuse transactions
- **Hospitals** just need confirmation the agent can make medical decisions
- **Escrow officers** just need to know the agent has authority to sign

The status code is the value. If it's OK, proceed. If it's REVOKED, SUPERSEDED, VOID_DECEASED, or 404, don't. No POST form needed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Attorney-in-Fact (Agent)** benefits from verification.

**Bank Transactions:** Proving to a skeptical bank teller that the "Margaret Willows POA" they are holding is verified and active. This prevents the "Manager Review" delay that often lasts 48 hours, allowing the agent to pay the principal's bills instantly.

**Emergency Medical:** Proving to a hospital at 2 AM that they are the verified "Medical Proxy" for a family member, allowing them to authorize life-saving surgery without legal delays.

## Third-Party Use

**Bank Compliance Officers**
**Asset Protection:** Before allowing a $100,000 wire from a senior's account, the bank scans the POA. "Verified by Willows-Law.com" ensure the document wasn't a "Home-Made" forgery used for elder abuse.

**Real Estate Escrow Officers**
**Closing Security:** Verifying that the person signing the closing documents has the **Verified Specific Power** to sell real estate. This prevents "Unauthorized Sale" litigation later.

**Nursing Home Administrators**
**Liability Defense:** Ensuring that the person making medical or financial decisions for a resident has a verified, active legal right to do so.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Agent" Fraud Problem**

- **Revocation Hiding:** An agent using a POA that was revoked last month to empty a bank account before the bank finds out.
- **Power Inflation:** Editing a "Medical Only" POA to include "Financial Access."
- **Expiration Faking:** Using a "Limited POA" for a house sale years after it was intended to expire.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Estate Planning Law Firms:** (The most trusted source).
**Online Notary Platforms:** (e.g., Notarize, Proof - hosting the session hashes).
**State Notary Registries.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Powers of attorney are drafted by legal professionals and overseen by the UK public guardian authority.

```
✓ opg.service.justice.gov.uk/verify — Issues durable powers of attorney and notary certifications
  ✓ publicguardian.gov.uk — Oversees UK powers of attorney and deputies
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the law firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (principal name, agent name, granted powers, effective date, notary seal number, signature date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the power of attorney and any revocations.


## Competition vs. QR/Holograms

| Feature | Live Verify | Holographic Seal | QR Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revocation** | **Instant.** Shows "REVOKED" today. | **Zero.** The seal is permanent. | **Variable.** Just a link. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lawyer. | **Physical.** Trust the sticker. | **Low.** Easily phished. |
| **Readability** | **High.** Full text is protected. | **None.** Seals don't protect text. | **None.** |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Hash protects details. | **Low.** Anyone can see the seal. | **Variable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Saturday Morning" reality. Banks are open when law offices are closed. A teller needs to know *right now* if a document is authentic. Live Verify turns the **Lawyer's Letterhead** into a live, high-authority trust anchor, enabling detection of elder abuse and fraud at the teller window.

See also [Legal Witnessing Future Architecture](../../docs/legal-witnessing-future-architecture.md) for a generalised model where witnesses attest to hash-specific documents and attestations are published to an independent registry — particularly relevant for LPAs where the donor's capacity is later contested.
