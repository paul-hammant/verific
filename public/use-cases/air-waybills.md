## What is an Air Waybill?

An **Air Waybill (AWB)** is the legal contract between a shipper and an airline. It serves three vital roles:
1.  **Receipt:** Proof the airline received the goods.
2.  **Contract of Carriage:** The legal agreement defining where the goods are going and who pays.
3.  **Guide:** It travels with the cargo and tells ground crews how to handle it (e.g., "Keep Frozen").

Unlike a passenger ticket which is digital-first, AWBs are often physically attached to the freight pallets in a plastic pouch.

## Data Verified

AWB Number (Master or House), shipper, consignee, pieces, weight, nature of goods, flight details, execution date, carrier signature.

**Document Types:**
- **Master Air Waybill (MAWB):** Issued by airline to freight forwarder.
- **House Air Waybill (HAWB):** Issued by forwarder to actual shipper.
- **e-AWB Receipt:** Printed copy of electronic record.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (Airline or Freight Forwarder) and shipment status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Booked** — Shipment registered but not yet received.
- **Received** — Cargo physically with carrier (RCS status).
- **Departed** — Cargo en route (DEP status).
- **Delivered** — Handed over to consignee (DLV status).

## Second-Party Use

The **Shipper** or **Consignee** benefits from verification.

**Proof of Shipment:** Sellers need to prove to buyers (and banks for Letters of Credit) that goods were actually handed over to the airline. A verified AWB is the "Golden Key" for unlocking payment.

**Customs Clearance:** Importers in the destination country present the AWB to Customs. Verification ensures the value/weight matches what was declared to the airline, preventing "double invoicing" fraud.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs Authorities**
**Risk Targeting:** Customs can verify the AWB data against the carrier's manifest *before* the plane lands. Discrepancies (e.g., AWB says "Books", manifest says "Electronics") trigger inspections.

**Insurance Companies**
**Cargo Claims:** When goods are lost/damaged, insurers verify the AWB to confirm the weight and nature of goods declared. If the shipper declared 50kg but claims for 500kg, verification catches the fraud.

**Truckers / Ground Handlers**
**Pickup Authority:** To prevent "fictitious pickup" (thieves posing as truckers), warehouses can verify the AWB presented by the driver matches the electronic release order.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Waybill" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Shipments:** Creating a fake AWB to claim payment from a buyer or bank (Trade Finance fraud) when no goods were shipped.
- **Weight Fraud:** Declaring low weight to airline to save freight costs, but high weight to customer to charge more.
- **Illegal Exports:** Mislabeling dangerous goods (batteries, chemicals) as "General Cargo" on the paper AWB to bypass safety checks.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Airlines:** (United Cargo, Lufthansa Cargo, etc.)
**Freight Forwarders:** (DHL Global Forwarding, Kuehne+Nagel, etc.)

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (shipment number, routing, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.

## Competition vs. e-AWB (Electronic Air Waybill)

| Feature | Live Verify | e-AWB (IATA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adoption** | **Universal.** Works even for small forwarders/airlines not fully integrated. | **High but not 100%.** Many lanes/countries still require paper. |
| **Physical Handoff** | **Strong.** Verifies the paper accompanying the freight in the truck. | **Weak.** Truckers often don't have access to the e-AWB system; they carry paper. |
| **Interoperability** | **Web-based.** Anyone (bank, insurer, customs) can verify. | **Siloed.** Cargo Community Systems (CCS) require membership/login. |
| **Data Integrity** | **Snapshot.** Proves what was printed at origin. | **Dynamic.** System data updates; audit trail of changes can be complex. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Despite the push for e-AWB, paper persists in the "Last Mile" (trucking to/from airport) and in customs procedures of developing nations. Live Verify turns that persistent paper into a trusted digital pointer, bridging the gap until 100% global digitization is achieved (which is decades away).

## What is a House Air Waybill (HAWB)?

If a small business ships a box of lenses from Switzerland to the US, they don't talk to the airline directly. They talk to a **Freight Forwarder** (like DHL or Kuehne+Nagel).

The forwarder gives them a **House Air Waybill (HAWB)**. It is the contract for that specific box. The forwarder then groups 100 boxes together into one "Master" shipment for the plane.

Fraud is common in the "Long Tail" of logistics: un-vetted forwarders sometimes create fake HAWBs to trick banks into releasing "Trade Financing" for goods that were never actually shipped. Verified hashes prove the forwarder's claim matches their official system.

</div>

## Data Verified

HAWB Number, Master Air Waybill (MAWB) number, Shipper name, Consignee name, Airport of Departure/Destination, total piece count, gross weight, cargo description (e.g., "Optical Lenses"), freight charges status (Prepaid/Collect), date of issuance, issuing forwarder ID.

**Document Types:**
- **House Air Waybill (HAWB):** Issued by the freight forwarder to the actual shipper.
- **Consolidation Manifest:** (Linked hash) grouping multiple HAWBs under one MAWB.
- **Cargo Charges Correction Advice (CCCA):** For post-flight billing changes.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Freight Forwarder) and current shipment status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Booked** — HAWB created; space reserved.
- **Received** — Cargo in forwarder's possession.
- **Manifested** — HAWB assigned to a flight (MAWB).
- **Delivered** — HAWB cargo handed over to consignee.
- **Void** — Replaced by a corrected waybill.

## Second-Party Use

The **Actual Shipper (SME / Manufacturer)** benefits from verification.

**Trade Finance:** Proving to a local bank that the $50,000 shipment of lenses is "Verified Manifested" on a specific flight. HAWBs are often required for payment under Letters of Credit; a verified hash prevents the bank from rejecting the document due to "Paperwork Uncertainty."

**Cargo Insurance:** Proving the exact weight and condition at the moment of handoff to the forwarder, ensuring no "Shadow Damage" is blamed on the shipper.

## Third-Party Use

**Consignees (Importers)**
**Payment Release:** A buyer in Boston can verify the HAWB provided by the Swiss seller to ensure the goods are actually in the Kuehne+Nagel system before wiring the final balance.

**Customs Brokers**
**Entry Vetting:** Verifying that the HAWB data matches the commercial invoice and the manifest before filing the entry with Customs, reducing the risk of "Data Mismatch" fines.

**Air Carriers (Airlines)**
**Consolidation Integrity:** Ensuring that the HAWB data provided by the forwarder for a consolidated pallet matches the official forwarder records.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Consolidation" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated HAWBs:** Small, un-vetted forwarders creating fake HAWBs for shipments that don't exist, to trick banks into providing "Trade Financing."
- **Weight Tampering:** Editing a HAWB to show 100kg instead of 1,000kg to save on high-priority air freight surcharges.
- **Description Hiding:** Changing "Hazardous Chemicals" to "Water Samples" on the HAWB to bypass airline safety restrictions.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Freight Forwarders (NVOCCs):** (e.g., DHL, Kuehne+Nagel, Expeditors).
**Logistics Platforms:** (e.g., Flexport, Forto).
**Cargo Community Systems (CCS).**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

```
✓ cargo.united.com/awb/verify — Carries air freight under IATA agreements
  ✓ iata.org — Sets standards for international air transport
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (shipment number, routing, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.

## Competition vs. IATA e-AWB

| Feature | Live Verify | IATA e-AWB (Cargo-XML) | Paper HAWB |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any small shipper/bank can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires complex IATA Cargo-XML messaging setup. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Forwarder. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** PDFs stay verifiable across systems. | **Medium.** Requires both parties to be on the e-AWB network. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the weight/count. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Forwarder Tail." While the top 50 forwarders use e-AWB, there are 50,000 small forwarders globally who still issue PDF/Paper HAWBs. Live Verify turn those **Manual Documents** into cryptographically trusted digital artifacts, bringing "Digital Logistics" trust to the entire global SME market.
