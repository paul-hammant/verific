## What is a Franchise Disclosure?

If you want to open a McDonald's or a 7-Eleven, you must receive a **Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD)**. This is a massive 200-page book where the brand must tell you the truth about how much money their stores actually make.

The most important part is **Item 19**, where the company lists verified profits.

Fraud is high-stakes: some "Salesmen" edit the FDD to hide lawsuits or to inflate the profits to trick people into buying a failing franchise. Verified hashes ensure the **financial claims** in your copy match the official version filed with the government.

## Data Verified

Franchisor legal name, Franchisee candidate name, proposed location/territory, FDD fiscal year/version, Item 19 earnings claims (numerical), initial fees, royalty rates, date of disclosure receipt (starting the 14-day clock), term length, renewal rights.

**Document Types:**
- **Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD):** The 200+ page primary disclosure.
- **Franchise Agreement:** The final signed 10-year contract.
- **Area Development Agreement:** For multi-unit investors.
- **Disclosure Receipt:** Mandatory proof of the 14-day cooling-off period.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`7-eleven.com`, `subway.com`, `mcdonalds.com`) and current agreement status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Disclosed** — FDD has been officially provided to the candidate.
- **Under Cooling-Off** — Mandated 14-day waiting period is active.
- **Fully Executed** — Agreement is signed and binding.
- **Terminated** — Franchise rights revoked (e.g., for non-payment or brand standards).

## Second-Party Use

The **Franchisee (Investor)** benefits from verification.

**Due Diligence Defense:** Proving to their lawyers and family that the "Item 19" earnings claims aren't just verbal promises from a salesman, but are verified, audited facts from the franchisor's own domain. This stops the most common form of franchise fraud: "Earnings Misrepresentation."

**SBA Loan Approval:** Proving to a lender that the "Franchise Package" is authentic and current. Lenders often reject outdated FDDs; a verified hash from the franchisor removes this delay.

## Third-Party Use

**The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**
**Enforcement:** Regulators can verify that the FDD version being handed to candidates matches the latest version filed with the government. Live Verify prevents "Selective Disclosure" where a franchisor hides a negative lawsuit from a prospect.

**Lenders / Banks**
**Risk Management:** Verifying the "Termination Provisions" and "Royalties" before lending $500,000 for a store build-out.

**Commercial Landlords**
**Tenant Vetting:** Ensuring that a new "Starbucks" or "7-Eleven" tenant actually has a verified franchise agreement in place before signing a 10-year commercial lease.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Item 19" Fraud Problem**

- **Earnings Inflation:** Editing the PDF to change a $100k average profit to $500k to trick a buyer into an expensive franchise.
- **Litigation Hiding:** Removing the pages from "Item 3" that list the 50 pending lawsuits against the franchisor.
- **Backdating Receipts:** Fabricating a disclosure receipt from 14 days ago to bypass the mandatory federal waiting period and force a fast closing.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Franchisors:** (National brands).
**Franchise Law Firms:** (Hosting verified hashes for their clients).
**State Securities Regulators:** (In "Registration States" like NY or CA).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Franchisors disclose franchise agreements under UK and US franchise regulations.

```
✓ franchise.mcdonalds.co.uk — Discloses franchise agreements
  ✓ bfa.org.uk — Registers UK franchise disclosures
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the franchisor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (franchise names, FDD versions, distribution dates, Item 19 details, expiration dates) — never financial or operational secrets — providing non-repudiation of the FDD.

## Competition vs. State Registry Search

| Feature | Live Verify | State Registry (Online) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Brand. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds "Item 19".** Protects the numbers. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the paper doc. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **User Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the meeting. | **Difficult.** Requires searching by state and paying fees. | **Instant.** |
| **Completeness** | **High.** Verifies the *specific* candidate's copy. | **Low.** Only shows the generic filing. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Sales Meeting" reality. Prospects decide to buy a franchise in a meeting with a development officer. They aren't going to search 50 different state databases. Live Verify turns the **Physical FDD** into a live digital checkpoint, ensuring the multi-million dollar investment decision is based on verified facts.
