## What is a Quality Control (QC) Report?

In manufacturing, the **Quality Control (QC) Report** (or Certificate of Conformance) is the proof that a specific batch of products was tested and met the required safety and engineering tolerances.

For critical components (e.g., bolts for an airplane wing, medical implants, or structural steel), a fake QC report can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life. Shady suppliers often "edit" a failed test result into a "PASS," or use a real report from a high-quality batch to cover for a cheaper, low-quality one. Verified hashes bind the **Batch Number, Test Results, and Inspector's Name** to the manufacturer's or the lab's domain (e.g., `boeing.com` or `sgs.com`).

## Data Verified

Batch/Lot number, product description, inspection date, inspector name/ID, test parameters (tensile, tolerance, chemical composition), pass/fail status, quantity inspected, customer name, facility ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Conformance (CoC):** Basic proof of meeting specs.
- **Mill Test Report (MTR):** Detailed chemical and physical analysis.
- **Dimensional Inspection Report:** Specific measurement data.
- **Destructive Testing Report:** Results from breaking sample units.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`precision-alloys.com`, `sgs.com`, `intertek.com`) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / PASS** — Report matches the lab's original testing snapshot.
- **Recalled** — **CRITICAL:** The batch has been recalled due to post-inspection discovery of defects.
- **Quarantined** — **ALERT:** Batch is under investigation; do not use in production.
- **Superseded** — A newer, corrected report exists.

### Scope enrichment: which batch, and how much of it

A QC report has no personal data, so on verification the issuer can safely **echo the batch scope** —
the accountability facts that stop a genuine report being applied beyond what it covers. The classic
fraud here is using a real report from a good batch to cover a cheaper one; echoing
`batch_covered`, `quantity_certified`, and `tested_on`/`retest_due` makes the covered batch and
quantity explicit, so a buyer can see that units outside the certified batch or quantity are *not*
covered even though the report verifies. This is safe enrichment — no personal data, and each field
reveals scope the terse claim withheld (see
[safety-certifications](safety-certifications.md) for the model treatment and
[verification-enrichment-hazards.md](../../docs/verification-enrichment-hazards.md) for when enrichment
is legitimate).

## Second-Party Use

The **Manufacturer (The Shop)** benefits from verification.

**Liability Shield:** If a customer claims a part failed, the shop can prove they performed the mandatory tests and had them verified at the time of shipping, defending against "Negligence" claims.

**Supply Chain Speed:** Attaching a verified hash to the shipping docs allows the buyer to skip their own "Incoming Inspection," reducing the time from the delivery dock to the assembly line by several days.

## Third-Party Use

**End-Users (e.g., Aircraft Maintenance)**
**Safety Audit:** A mechanic installing a part can scan the QC report. If the hash returns **"RECALLED - EMBRITTLEMENT RISK,"** they can stop the installation immediately, potentially preventing a crash.

**Government Safety Agencies (FAA, FDA)**
**Regulatory Oversight:** During a routine audit, the agency can scan random QC reports from the company's files. Live Verify ensures the company isn't "Fabricating" tests to hide production errors.

**Insurance Loss Adjusters**
**Root Cause Analysis:** After an industrial accident, the insurer verifies the QC reports of all critical components to determine if the failure was due to a faulty part or improper maintenance.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Test-Result Tweak" Fraud Problem**

- **Tolerance Inflation:** Changing a "FAIL" result (e.g., 149,000 PSI) to a "PASS" (150,000 PSI) in a PDF editor.
- **Batch Swapping:** Using one "PASS" report for multiple different batches, some of which were never tested.
- **Credential Forgery:** Using a senior inspector's name on a report created by an untrained junior employee.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Internal Factory Labs.**
**Independent Third-Party Labs (SGS, Intertek).**
**Standards Bodies.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Test parameters and batch volumes are sensitive "Production Secrets." The hash must be salted to prevent competitors from mapping a factory's yield or capacity.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Inspection bodies like SGS verify quality control and compliance to ISO 9001 standards.

```
✓ qc.sgs.com — Inspects products and issues quality compliance reports
  ✓ ukas.com — Accredits UK inspection bodies
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Quality Control is about "The Last Line of Defense." By turning static test reports into live digital bridges, we create a transparent chain of safety that spans the entire global supply chain.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the manufacturer's or lab's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (batch number, report number, inspection date, product name, test results, inspector ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the quality control inspection results.
