## Data Verified

Transaction ID (Reference #), Sender phone/name, Recipient phone/name, exact amount (local currency), service fees, timestamp (to the second), current account balance (optional/linked), agent ID (for cash-in/out), issuing mobile money operator.

**Document Types:**
- **P2P Transfer Receipt:** Sent between individuals.
- **Pay-Bill Receipt:** For utility or retail payments.
- **Cash-Out Confirmation:** Issued by a physical agent kiosk.
- **Micro-Loan Statement:** (Linked hash) for mobile-based credit.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`safaricom.co.ke`, `gcash.com`, `mtn.com`) and current transaction standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Completed** — Funds have been verified as delivered to the recipient.
- **Cancelled** — Transaction reversed; funds returned to sender.
- **Pending** — Transfer in progress or held for compliance review.
- **Void** — Transaction ID not found or details mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Sender / Recipient** benefits from verification.

**Payment Proof:** Proving to a small merchant or landlord that the "Ksh 12,500" was *actually sent* and isn't just a "Fake SMS" or "Altered Screenshot." In emerging markets, "Fake SMS" fraud is a massive problem; a verified hash from the operator's domain provides instant, authoritative proof.

**Tax Compliance:** Providing verified digital receipts to a local tax authority or NGO auditor to justify business expenses in a cash-heavy environment.

## Third-Party Use

**Micro-Lenders / Fintechs**
**Credit Scoring:** Instantly verifying the "Transaction History" of an unbanked individual by scanning their paper or digital receipts. Verified volume and consistency act as a "Reputation Signal" for mobile-based loans.

**Supply Chain Distributors**
**Order Authorization:** A truck driver can verify a small shop owner's mobile payment receipt at the loading dock before handing over a case of goods.

**Law Enforcement / Anti-Money Laundering**
**Fund Tracing:** Verifying the "Source of Funds" for high-value mobile transfers without requiring full account access.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake SMS" Fraud Problem**

- **SMS Spoofing:** Using a computer to send a fake "M-Pesa Confirmation" message to a merchant's phone to steal goods.
- **Screenshot Alteration:** Changing the name or amount on a legitimate receipt PDF to trick a landlord.
- **Duplicate Use:** Showing the same "Completed" receipt to multiple people to "pay" for different items.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Mobile Network Operators (MNOs):** (Safaricom, MTN, Orange, Vodafone).
**Super-Apps:** (GCash, GrabPay, bKash).
**Agent Networks:** (Providing the "First-Mile" verified receipts).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Mobile money data involves personal phone numbers and cash flow. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Mapping" of a community's financial activity.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Mobile network operators are regulated by central banks to issue payment receipts.

```
✓ mpesa.safaricom.co.ke — Issues mobile money transaction receipts
  ✓ centralbank.go.ke — Regulates Kenyan financial services
    ✓ go.ke — Kenyan government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the mobile operator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (Transaction ID, Sender phone, Recipient phone, exact amount, timestamp) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the transaction receipt and an audit trail central banks can inspect.

## Competition vs. SMS Confirmation

| Feature | Live Verify | SMS Confirmation | Scanned Image / PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Transaction ID*. | **Low.** Easily spoofed with PC software. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Operator. | **Network-Bound.** Prone to SIM-swapping. | **Visual.** |
| **Availability** | **Instant.** Verified via QR/Hash. | **Laggy.** SMS delivery often fails in congested areas. | **Instant.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Basic.** Works on dumb-phones. | **Visual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Merchant's Defend." Small shop owners in Africa and Asia lose millions to "Fake SMS" scams. They need a **High-Trust, Offline-capable** way to verify that the numbers on the screen match the ledger. Live Verify turns the **Mobile Screen** into a live, trusted clinical link, ensuring the "Digital Cash" is actually in the bank.
