## What is an Alarm Installer License?

In many states, anyone who installs security cameras, burglar alarms, or fire sensors in your home must be licensed and background-checked by the State Police or a regulatory bureau.

This license proves that the technician:
1.  **Is not a criminal:** They have passed a fingerprint-based background check.
2.  **Is trained:** They understand fire codes and electrical safety.
3.  **Is insured:** If they damage your home or the system fails, there is a bond or insurance to cover it.

Always scan the badge before letting a "technician" into your home to learn your security codes.

## Data Verified

Licensee name, photo (hash), license number, company affiliation, expiration date, endorsements (fire, burglary, access control), issuing state agency.

**Document Types:**
- **Pocket Card:** Carried by the technician.
- **Wall Certificate:** Posted at the business office.
- **Monitoring Station License:** For the central station itself.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dps.texas.gov`, `bsis.ca.gov`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — License is valid.
- **Suspended** — Disciplinary action or lapsed insurance.
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from the industry.
- **Expired** — Renewal fee not paid.

## Why Would You Bother Verifying?

An alarm installer is not just another tradesperson. They learn the layout of your home, the location of every sensor and camera, the bypass codes, the monitoring schedule, and which entry points are covered. An impostor with that information does not need to break in — they know exactly how to walk in undetected. This makes alarm installation one of the highest-trust home-access professions, alongside locksmiths and gas engineers. The difference is that the consequences of a compromised alarm system may not be discovered until a burglary occurs — and even then, the connection to the "installer" who visited months earlier may never be made.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner** or **Business Owner** benefits from verification.

**Safety Check:** Before letting a stranger into your home to install cameras/sensors, scanning their ID card verifies they are a licensed, background-checked professional and not an impostor casing the house.

**Insurance Compliance:** Many homeowner insurance policies give discounts for monitored alarms, but *only* if installed by a licensed professional. A verified license proves eligibility.

## Third-Party Use

**Police Departments**
**False Alarm Fines:** Police often refuse to respond to unpermitted alarms. Verifying the monitoring company's license ensures they are a legitimate entity that follows verified dispatch protocols (ECV - Enhanced Call Verification).

**Fire Marshals**
**Inspection:** Fire alarm systems must be installed by licensed fire professionals. Marshals can scan the installer's badge on-site to ensure code compliance.

**General Contractors**
**Subcontractor Vetting:** Ensuring the security sub-contractor is licensed prevents liability issues on large construction projects.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Installer" Fraud Problem**

- **Casing Burglars:** Criminals posing as alarm technicians to gain access to homes, learn codes, and identify valuables.
- **Unlicensed Moonlighting:** Technicians doing side jobs without company insurance/bonding. If they burn the house down, the homeowner is unprotected.
- **Expired Licenses:** Technicians working after their background check has lapsed.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Bureaus:** (e.g., California BSIS, Texas PSB)
**State Police:** (In some jurisdictions)

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Security alarm installers are licensed and monitored by the UK private security regulator.

```
✓ sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/verify — Issues installer licenses and monitoring permits
  ✓ sia.homeoffice.gov.uk — Regulates the UK private security industry
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the license.


## Competition vs. Online Lookups

| Feature | Live Verify | State Website Lookup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the badge at the door. | **Slow.** Ask for name, type it in, scroll results. |
| **Photo ID** | **Strong.** Verification can display the official photo to compare with the person standing there. | **Weak.** Text-only lookups don't show the face, allowing ID theft (using a real name but wrong person). |
| **Privacy** | **Targeted.** Checks *this* person. | **Open.** Anyone can scrape the whole database. |

**Why this remains strong:** State website lookup should remain primary where it is practical. But at the doorstep the homeowner is making an immediate entry decision from the badge in hand, often without a comfortable or realistic registry workflow. That makes this a strong threshold-verification case rather than an attempt to replace the licensing database.
