## Framing Insights

**"Why would you bother?" (Pattern A):** The I-693 is completed in a sealed envelope that the applicant carries — unopened — to their USCIS interview. The seal is the only tamper evidence. But fake civil surgeons and fraudulent clinics exist: they charge for an "exam" that never happens, produce a clean I-693 for applicants who would fail the real screening (communicable diseases, incomplete vaccinations), and pocket the fee. The applicant gets a sealed envelope containing a fabricated result. USCIS has no fast way to distinguish this from a legitimate exam without contacting the clinic. A `verify:` line bound to the civil surgeon's clinic domain gives the adjudicator instant confirmation that the exam was actually performed by a designated physician.

**Specific consequences (Pattern E):** The I-693 screens for communicable diseases (tuberculosis, syphilis) and required vaccinations. A fraudulent clean result means an applicant with active TB enters the general population without treatment. Public health depends on these exams being real, not just on the paperwork looking real.

## Data Verified

Applicant name, Alien Registration Number (A-Number), Date of birth, Civil Surgeon name/ID, Clinic location, Date of medical examination, Vaccination status (Complete/Waiver), presence of Class A/B medical conditions, signature of surgeon, date of signature.

**Document Types:**
- **I-693 Medical Form:** The primary 14-page federal medical report.
- **Vaccination Record Extract:** For school or workplace proof.
- **Panel Physician Report:** For applicants outside the U.S. (DS-2054).
- **Communicable Disease Waiver:** (Linked hash) if required.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Civil Surgeon's Clinic or Health System) and current result status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Medical exam matches the clinic's secure digital record.
- **Incomplete** — One or more vaccinations or tests (e.g., TB) are pending.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Results are > 2 years old; new exam required.
- **Void** — Results retracted (e.g., due to laboratory error or surgeon disciplinary action).

## Second-Party Use

The **Applicant** benefits from verification.

**Submission Confidence:** Proving to themselves (and their lawyer) that the "Sealed Envelope" they are handing to USCIS contains a "Verified Passed" exam. Verification prevents the "Dead Air" period where an applicant doesn't know if their doctor actually signed the form correctly until they get a rejection notice months later.

**Workplace Compliance:** Providing verified proof of vaccination status to an employer without needing to provide the full, private medical history.

## Third-Party Use

**USCIS Officers**
**Intake Integrity:** When an officer receives a "Sealed I-693 Envelope," they currently have to trust the physical seal hasn't been tampered with. Live Verify allows the officer to scan the hash on the form *before* opening. "Verified by Fairport Health" ensures the contents match the surgeon's original digital filing, stopping "Envelope Tampering" fraud.

**Immigration Attorneys**
**Quality Control:** Verifying that the Civil Surgeon is actually on the USCIS-approved list and that their license was active on the date of the signature.

**Airlines / Port of Entry**
**Public Health Vetting:** For international arrivals, verifying the medical clearance of a refugee or immigrant before boarding.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dirty Seal" Fraud Problem**

- **Envelope Tampering:** Applicants carefully steaming open the "Sealed" envelope to hide a positive TB or Syphilis test result before re-sealing it.
- **Fake Surgeons:** Unlicensed individuals posing as "Civil Surgeons" and selling fake I-693 forms for cash to immigrants who fear medical results.
- **Vaccination Forgery:** Fabricating a vaccination history to avoid the $500 cost of mandatory shots.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**USCIS-Designated Civil Surgeons:** (Private doctors in the USA).
**Panel Physicians:** (Overseas doctors for State Dept).
**Public Health Clinics.**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I-693s contain highly sensitive medical diagnoses. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for people with specific diseases.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Civil surgeons and panel physicians issue I-693 medical exam results under US immigration health regulator authority (CDC in the US).

```
✓ panelphysician.example.com/verify — Issues immigration medical examination results
  ✓ cdc.gov/immigrant-refugee-health — Administers US immigration health screening
    ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the civil surgeon's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (applicant A-Number, date of exam, vaccination status, result status) — never sensitive personal medical information — providing non-repudiation of the medical exam results.


## Competition vs. e-Medical (State Dept)

| Feature | Live Verify | e-Medical (Electronic Filing) | Paper I-693 (Standard) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Doctor. | **Gov-Bound.** Direct to server. | **Zero.** Trusted only via seal. |
| **User Access** | **High.** Applicant can see "Certified" status. | **Zero.** Black-box system; applicant sees nothing. | **Manual.** |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any clinic with a URL. | **Restricted.** Requires expensive e-Medical software. | **Universal.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if results retracted. | **High.** | **Static.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Local Clinic" reality. Most USCIS civil surgeons are small private clinics who do not have the IT budget for complex federal "e-Filing" integrations. They still use paper. Live Verify turns that **Mandatory Paper Form** into a live digital checkpoint, bringing "Government-Level" integrity to local medical offices.
