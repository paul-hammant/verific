## Data Verified

Test taker name, registration/appointment ID, test type (iBT/Paper), test date, individual section scores (0-30 scale), total aggregate score, test center ID (or "Home Edition"), date of report issuance, validity period.

**Document Types:**
- **TOEFL / IELTS Score Report:** The primary academic entry requirement.
- **DELF / DALF (French):** Official diplomas for life.
- **DELE (Spanish):** Official certification from Instituto Cervantes.
- **JLPT (Japanese):** Proficiency levels N1-N5.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ets.org`, `ielts.org`, `britishcouncil.org`) and current score standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Scores match the official testing database and are un-altered.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Test date was > 2 years ago; scores are no longer valid for admissions.
- **Invalid** — Registration ID not found or score mismatch.
- **Under Review** — Scores flagged for statistical anomalies (e.g., potential cheating).

## Second-Party Use

The **Test Taker** (second party) receives the score report from the testing organization (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of their language proficiency scores. Most of the time, the report sits in their application files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the scores match what the testing organization's system recorded and haven't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If they apply to multiple universities, immigration programs, or employers—they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to pay for multiple official score reports or contact the testing organization.

## Third-Party Use

The test taker (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**University Registrars**
**Instant Vetting:** Admissions officers can instantly verify the scores of 1,000+ international applicants. Live Verify allows the university to skip the manual "Verification Code" login process for every single PDF, clearing the backlog in seconds.

**Employers (Global Teams)**
**Capability Proof:** Verifying the language claims of remote workers or expats before issuing contracts for client-facing roles.

**Immigration Officers**
**Border Integrity:** Instantly verifying the "English Requirement" documents of a traveler at a port of entry.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Score Inflation" Fraud Problem**

- **Numerical Tampering:** Editing a "22" in Writing to a "30" to meet a prestigious university's minimum requirement.
- **Date Stretching:** Altering a 2022 test date to 2026 to hide that the scores have already expired.
- **Impersonation:** Using a high-scoring friend's report but editing the name and photo.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Global Testing Giants (ETS, IELTS Partnership, Pearson)
- National Ministries of Education
- Language Institutes

**Privacy Salt:** Required. While test reports contain unique registration IDs, they also include enumerable values—score ranges (0-30, bands 1-9), standard test dates, common names, and predictable section breakdowns. A malicious actor, predatory recruiter, or competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer test taker performance, map student populations by institution, or target specific demographics. Salt protects this sensitive educational and personal information.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Language proficiency tests like IELTS are accredited and regulated by Ofqual in the UK, which ensures consistent standards across all test administrations and results.

```
✓ results.britishcouncil.org/ielts/verify — Issues language proficiency test scores
  ✓ ofqual.gov.uk — Regulates qualifications and exams in England
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the testing organization's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (test dates, score ranges, section breakdowns, test center IDs) — never plaintext such as test taker names — providing non-repudiation of issuing the language proficiency certificate.

## Competition vs. Official Score Reports (Electronic)

| Feature | Live Verify | Official Electronic Report | Scanned PDF / Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Control** | **High.** Student shares only the *Verified PDF*. | **Low.** Testing body sends data directly to the school. | **High.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Test Body (ETS). | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Takes 3-7 days to "Send" and "Receive." | **Instant.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Medium.** Fees of $20+ per report are standard. | **None.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Application Window" reality. Students are often applying to 10+ schools at once. Paying $200 in "Score Reporting Fees" is a massive burden. Live Verify turns the **One-Time Score Report** into a "Portable Trust Asset" that can be verified by any university for free, saving students money and schools time.
