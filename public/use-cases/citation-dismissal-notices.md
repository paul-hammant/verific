## What is a Citation Dismissal Notice?

A citation dismissal notice confirms that a traffic ticket, parking citation, code violation, or other infraction has been dismissed, rescinded, or successfully contested. The violation no longer counts against the person's record.

Citation fraud is common: fake dismissals to avoid insurance increases, fabricated "proof of correction" documents, and forged court orders to clear driving records.

## Data Verified

Issuing authority, citation/ticket number, defendant/violator name, violation type and code, citation date, dismissal date, reason for dismissal, any residual obligations.

**Document Types:**
- **Traffic Citation Dismissal:** Moving violation dismissed by court.
- **Parking Citation Voided:** Parking ticket cancelled.
- **Code Violation Abatement:** Property violation corrected and closed.
- **Proof of Correction:** Fix-it ticket verified as corrected.
- **Red Light Camera Dismissal:** Photo enforcement citation dismissed.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`courts.ca.gov`, `chicago.gov`) and citation status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Dismissed** — Citation thrown out, no violation on record.
- **Voided** — Citation cancelled as issued in error.
- **Abated** — Violation corrected, case closed.
- **Reduced** — Violation reduced to lesser offense or fine only.
- **Appealed** — Dismissal under appeal by issuing agency.

## Second-Party Use

The **Defendant/Violator** benefits from verification.

**Insurance Rates:** Moving violations increase insurance premiums. A verified dismissal proves the violation shouldn't affect rates.

**Driving Record:** CDL holders and others with driving-sensitive jobs need clean records. Verified dismissals ensure DMV records are accurate.

**Property Sales:** Code violation history can affect property sales. Verified abatement proves issues were resolved.

**Rental Car Disputes:** When rental companies claim unpaid citations, verified dismissals prove the tickets were already resolved.

## Third-Party Use

**Insurance Companies**
**Rate Setting:** Insurers access driving records for underwriting. Verified dismissals ensure accurate rating.

**Employers**
**Driving Jobs:** Companies hiring drivers check MVR records. Verified dismissals explain any anomalies.

**DMV / Motor Vehicle Agencies**
**Record Updates:** When dismissals aren't reflected on MVR, verified court orders support record corrections.

**Title Companies**
**Property Sales:** Code violations can create liens. Verified abatement confirms liens are released.

**Toll Authorities**
**Dispute Resolution:** When toll violations are dismissed, verified notices prevent continued collection efforts.

## Verification Architecture

**The Citation Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Dismissals:** Forged court orders claiming violations were dismissed.
- **Proof of Correction Fraud:** Fake "fix-it" ticket sign-offs.
- **Point Manipulation:** Fraudulent dismissals to keep licenses valid.
- **Insurance Premium Fraud:** Fake dismissals to avoid rate increases.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Traffic Courts:** Municipal and superior courts handling traffic matters.
**Parking Authorities:** City parking enforcement divisions.
**Code Enforcement:** Municipal code compliance departments.
**DMV:** State motor vehicle departments.
**Private Operators:** (Red light cameras, toll roads) issuing citations.

**DMV Integration**

Courts could submit dismissal hashes to DMV along with case dispositions. When drivers dispute MVR entries, the verified hash provides proof of dismissal.

**Insurance Reporting**

Insurance companies could query court verification endpoints when violations appear on MVR, automatically excluding dismissed citations from rating.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Adjudicates citation dismissals and violation records.

```
✓ courts.ca.gov/dismissal/verify — Adjudicates citation dismissals and violation records
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the court's or issuing authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (citation number, violation type, dismissal date, reason, issuing court or agency) — never defendant names or personal identifiers — providing non-repudiation of the dismissal and an audit trail for insurance and record-correction disputes.
