## What is Courier Verification?

Most deliveries don't need verification. An Amazon envelope dropped at the door, a letterbox parcel, a "leave in safe place" delivery — the courier comes and goes without meaningful interaction. The package is the point, and it either arrives or it doesn't.

Verification matters when the delivery requires the resident to **open the door and engage with the courier** — and especially when the courier needs to **enter the property**:

- **Signature-required deliveries** — the courier needs face-to-face interaction. This is the entry point for home-invasion attempts disguised as deliveries.
- **Large or heavy items requiring indoor delivery** — furniture, appliances, white goods. "We need to bring this to your kitchen" is a different trust decision from accepting an envelope.
- **High-value deliveries** — jewellery, electronics, medication. The courier may know what's in the box. A fake courier with a real tracking number is a targeted theft.
- **Elderly or vulnerable residents** — someone living alone, previously targeted, or with carers visiting. Any unexpected knock at the door is higher-stakes.
- **Rural or isolated properties** — no neighbours, no CCTV, longer emergency response time.

Different residents will view these risks differently. A young professional in a city flat may never feel the need to verify a courier. An elderly person living alone in a rural area may want to verify anyone who knocks. The verification is available for those who want it, not mandated for everyone.

Live Verify allows a resident to scan the driver's ID badge or a printed delivery manifest to confirm: **"Is this person a current employee of this company, and are they assigned to deliver here today?"**

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the resident's perspective. The doorstep interaction is initiated by the courier.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The courier controls whether a package is delivered, returned, or marked as refused — and the resident may be expecting something time-sensitive or valuable.

**Verification asymmetry:** The resident is being asked to open the door or allow someone into their home, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the person is a current employee of the claimed company on an assigned route. This asymmetry is sharpest for deliveries that require indoor access or face-to-face interaction, and for residents who are vulnerable or isolated.

## Data Verified

Courier name, employee ID, company division (Express/Ground/Freight), hub location, photograph (via hash), expiration date, background check status.

**Document Types:**
- **Courier ID Badge:** Worn by the driver.
- **Delivery Manifest (Door Tag):** Left on the door for missed deliveries.
- **Contractor Identification:** For third-party "Gig" delivery partners.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`fedex.com`, `ups.com`, `dhl.com`, `usps.gov`) and the driver's current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **On Duty** — Driver is currently clocked in and assigned to a route.
- **Verified** — Person is an active employee in good standing.
- **Inactive** — Person is no longer employed (e.g., fired or resigned).
- **Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** This ID has been reported stolen or misused.

## Second-Party Use

The **Courier / Driver** (second party) receives the ID badge from the courier company (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified credential. Most of the time, the badge sits in their pocket or lanyard—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that their employment status is active and properly recorded in the company's system.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about their employment, delivery assignments, or an incident during a delivery, they have cryptographic proof of their authorized status ready without needing to contact the company.

## Third-Party Use

The courier (second party) may hand the verified credential to various third parties:

**Property Managers / Gated Communities**
**Access Control:** Front-desk guards can instantly verify the identity of drivers from 10 different companies (FedEx, UPS, Amazon, local couriers) using a single verification app, rather than relying on their ability to recognize 10 different fake-able badges.

**Residents / Recipients**
**Safety Verification:** Before opening the door to a stranger, a resident can scan the driver's badge to confirm they are a verified on-duty courier for a real company, preventing "Fake Courier" home invasions.

**Insurance Companies**
**Liability Verification:** Verifying that a driver involved in a parking lot accident was actually on duty for the claimed company at the time of the incident.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Delivery Camouflage" Fraud Problem**

- **Uniform Theft:** Criminals buying old uniforms on eBay to pose as drivers.
- **Stolen IDs:** Using a lost/stolen badge to gain access to high-end apartment complexes.
- **Fake Door Tags:** Leaving "Missed Delivery" tags with a fake phone number to steal PII or payment info for "Re-delivery fees."

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- National Courier Hubs (FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS)
- Regional Delivery Services
- Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Providers

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Courier badges combine predictable values—partial names, hub locations, and standard ID formats. More critically, the hash must be salted to prevent "Stalking" attacks where someone could enumerate driver IDs and routes, creating serious safety risks for drivers. Salt also prevents "Competitor Reconnaissance" where rival firms could map out a company's delivery density and staffing patterns.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the courier company's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (employee ID, hub assignment, on-duty status, route zone) — never driver full names, home addresses, or specific delivery routes — providing non-repudiation of credentials and employment status, with immutable timestamp proof critical for incident investigations.

## Privacy-Preserving Badge Design

Courier drivers complete 100-300 stops per day. Each delivery is a 10-30 second interaction where their badge is visible to the recipient, neighbors, and any doorbell cameras recording the street. Exposing full names to this volume of strangers creates unnecessary privacy risk.

**Badge shows:** First name + last initial + ID number (e.g., "Mark S 7766")

**Verification returns:** Photo, on-duty status, assigned route area, employer domain

**Why this works:**
- **Recipient gets what they need:** Photo match + confirmation courier is on-duty for a real company
- **Driver privacy protected:** Full name not broadcast to hundreds of households and doorbell recordings daily
- **Accountability preserved:** FedEx/UPS maintains full HR records; package disputes traceable via ID and timestamp
- **Audit trail intact:** All verifications logged by the courier company

This pattern applies across the gig economy: anyone doing 50+ brief interactions daily deserves privacy-preserving credentials rather than full name exposure.

## Text-to-Hash Suitability

**Primary scenario: Physical OCR, not text-to-hash.**

This use case is fundamentally **doorstep-based**. The verification happens in person: a resident looks through a peephole, a doorman stands at a lobby desk, a security guard checks credentials at a gate. The badge is physical (lanyard, card, e-ink display), and the verification happens via camera/OCR on the spot.

**Text-to-hash applicability is limited to:**
- **Insurance claims / HR disputes:** An employee emails a photo of their badge to HR or an insurer. The recipient selects the text (employee ID, salt, verify line) from the digital image and verifies.
- **After-incident verification:** Police or investigators reviewing doorbell camera footage that captured the badge details.
- **Contractor onboarding records:** Property managers archiving digital copies of badges for compliance files.

**Why this matters:** Don't build a text-to-hash-first solution for courier verification. The primary value is real-time physical authentication. Text-to-hash is a secondary use case for after-the-fact verification.

## Rationale

Courier verification bridges the "Uniform Trust Gap." By binding the physical presence of a delivery person to the company's digital HR/Dispatch record, it protects both the public from crime and the courier companies from brand damage.

## What is a Driver ID Badge?

With the rise of "Gig Work" (like Amazon Flex), the person delivering your package is often driving their own personal car and wearing a simple vest.

The **Driver Badge** is their "Security Key." It proves they are an authorized worker currently on an active route.

Scammers often wear fake high-visibility vests to get inside apartment buildings or gated communities to "case" homes or steal packages. Live Verify allows a doorman or resident to scan the badge and see a green "ON-DUTY" status from the company's domain, stopping "Fake Courier" home invasions.

## Data Verified

Driver name, photo (hash), route ID, vehicle type/plate (partial), employment status (Active/On-Duty), delivery company name, date of authorization.

**Document Types:**
- **Driver Lanyard ID:** Carried by the driver.
- **Vehicle Window Permit:** For independent contractors (DSP/Flex).
- **Delivery App Dashboard:** Digital proof shown on the driver's phone.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`amazon.com`, `ups.com`, `fedex.com`) and current worker status.

**Status Indications:**
- **On-Duty** — Driver is currently assigned to a route in this area.
- **Off-Duty** — Shift has ended; badge should not be used for access.
- **Suspended** — Driver under review; access restricted.
- **Invalid** — Badge reported lost or stolen.

## Second-Party Use

The **Delivery Driver** (second party) receives the ID badge from the logistics company (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified credential proving their employment and route assignment. Most of the time, the badge sits on their lanyard—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that their on-duty status is active and properly recorded in the company's system.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about their employment, an incident during a delivery, or access issues, they have cryptographic proof of their authorized status ready without needing to contact the company.

## Third-Party Use

The delivery driver (second party) may hand the verified credential to various third parties:

**Vulnerable Residents (Elderly/Alone)**
**Personal Safety:** Before opening the door to a stranger, a resident can ask to see the driver's badge through a window or doorbell camera. Scanning the hash confirms the person is a "Verified On-Duty" driver for a real company, preventing "Fake Courier" home invasions.

**Security Guards (Doormen)**
**Lobby Integrity:** Instantly verifying that the "Independent Contractor" (Flex driver) actually has an active route for the building, preventing unauthorized people from accessing package rooms.

**Law Enforcement**
**Impersonation Checks:** Verifying the credentials of individuals claiming to be "Delivery Drivers" during neighborhood patrols or suspicious activity stops.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Courier" Fraud Problem**

- **Porch Piracy Plus:** Scammers wearing high-visibility vests and fake lanyards to gain entry into apartment buildings or homes to steal packages or case the interior.
- **Identity Theft:** Using a real driver's badge after they have been fired to maintain access to high-value buildings.
- **Route Faking:** Pretending to be on a "Rush Delivery" to bypass security controls in private communities.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Logistics Giants (Amazon, UPS, FedEx, DHL)
- Food Delivery Platforms (DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub)
- Local DSPs (Delivery Service Partners)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Driver badges combine predictable elements—partial names, regions, and standard ID formats. More critically, salt prevents "Stalking" attacks where someone could enumerate driver IDs to track specific individuals across routes, creating serious personal safety risks. This is especially important for gig workers who interact with hundreds of strangers daily.

*The server rotates the salt — after each successful scan (burn-on-verify) or on TTL expiry of an unscanned salt — and the badge re-renders to match. The screen is always in lockstep with the salt the server will honour, so a photograph is worthless unless verified in the moment. See [E-Ink ID Cards](../e-ink-id-cards.md) for how this prevents cloning and protects driver privacy.*

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Delivery platforms issue courier verification documents to confirm that drivers are currently authorized to make deliveries. Self-authorized by their platform membership and real-time vetting authority.

```
✓ drivers.deliveroo.co.uk/verify — Issues delivery courier verification and driver credentials
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition vs. In-App Notifications

| Feature | Live Verify | App Notification (Amazon App) | Uniform / Physical Badge |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to duty status. | **High.** Direct from server. | **Low.** Easily bought online. |
| **Accessibility** | **Universal.** Doormen can verify without an app. | **Closed Loop.** Only the *recipient* sees the alert. | **Visual.** Trusted only via logo. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Company. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily faked. |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Zero.** Doorman cannot see the customer's phone. | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Doorman Dilemma." In a large apartment building, the doorman doesn't know which of the 500 residents ordered an Amazon package. They cannot see the resident's private app notification. Live Verify turns the **Driver's Badge** into a public-facing trust bridge, allowing the doorman to verify the driver independently.

## Food Delivery Drivers

Food delivery is a distinct variant of courier verification. The parcel courier leaves a
box on a porch; the food delivery driver hands you an open bag of food at your door,
often late at night. The trust requirements are different.

**Why it's higher-risk than parcel delivery:**
- **Direct handoff.** The customer opens the door and takes food from a stranger's hands — no "leave at door" option for hot meals.
- **Home address + ordering pattern.** The driver knows what you eat, when you're home, and that you just spent money. This is richer personal data than "a box arrived."
- **Late night / solo recipients.** A significant share of food deliveries happen after dark to people alone at home.
- **No uniform.** Parcel couriers at least wear branded uniforms. Food delivery drivers use their own clothes and cars — there is nothing visual to authenticate.
- **Platform distance.** DoorDash, Deliveroo, and Uber Eats classify drivers as independent contractors, creating less institutional accountability than FedEx or UPS employees.

**The verification scenario:**

A customer orders food. The app says "Your driver is Priya." A person arrives at the
door. Is this actually Priya? Today the customer's only check is comparing a small
thumbnail photo in the app (which may be outdated or belong to someone else's account)
with the person standing on the doorstep.

With Live Verify, the driver shows a badge (phone screen or printed card) with:

<div style="max-width: 400px; margin: 24px auto; font-family: sans-serif; border: 2px solid #e21236; border-radius: 12px; background: #fff; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">
  <div style="background: #e21236; color: #fff; padding: 12px 15px; display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.3em; margin-right: 10px;">DoorDash</div>
    <div style="font-size: 0.75em; opacity: 0.9; border-left: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.4); padding-left: 10px;">Delivery Partner<br>Active Dasher</div>
  </div>
  <div style="padding: 15px; display: flex;">
    <div style="width: 80px; margin-right: 15px;">
      <div style="width: 80px; height: 100px; background: #eee; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; color: #777; font-size: 0.65em;">[PHOTO]</div>
    </div>
    <div style="flex-grow: 1; color: #000; font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.6;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">Priya K 88214</div>
      <div>Region: Brooklyn, NY</div>
      <div>Salt: 4r8n2w6j</div>
      <div style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 4px;">vfy:dasher.doordash.com</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

The customer scans and sees a green "Active Dasher" confirmation from `doordash.com` with
a photo match — not a thumbnail controlled by the driver, but a photo hash verified
against the platform's domain.

**Account sharing / multi-apping fraud:**

A known problem in food delivery: drivers share accounts with unvetted friends or family
members. Person A passes the background check; Person B (who might not pass) delivers
under Person A's account. The platform's in-app photo check is easily defeated by showing
a screenshot. A verified badge with a rotating salt and photo hash is much harder to share
because the salt changes and the photo must match.

**Food safety angle:**

Some jurisdictions require food handlers to hold a valid food safety certificate. The
badge payload could include a linked hash for the driver's food handling certification,
letting the customer verify not just "this is a real driver" but "this driver has a valid
food safety credential" — relevant for allergy-sensitive or immunocompromised recipients.

**Platforms:**
- DoorDash / Dasher
- Uber Eats
- Deliveroo
- Grubhub
- Just Eat / Menulog
- Instacart / Gopuff (grocery delivery — same trust model)
