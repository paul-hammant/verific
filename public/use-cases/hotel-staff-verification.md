## What is a Hotel Staff Badge?

In a large hotel, a "Maintenance" or "Room Service" worker might knock on your door at 11 PM. As a guest, you are at your most vulnerable — you don't know if this person was scheduled, if they're still employed, or if they're an impostor.

The **Staff ID Badge** is the worker's proof that they are authorized to be in the guest hallways.

"Fake Uniform" home-invasions happen when burglars buy high-visibility vests or fake Hilton/Marriott shirts to gain entry to rooms. Live Verify allows a guest to scan the worker's badge through the peephole or doorbell camera. Seeing a green "ON-DUTY" status from the hotel's domain ensures the person at the door is a **Verified Employee**.

**This pattern also applies** to hospitals, apartment buildings, and event venues—anywhere mobile service staff enter private spaces in ungated, high-turnover environments.

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the hotel guest's perspective. The knock on the door is initiated by staff or someone claiming to be staff.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** Hotel staff hold master keys and can enter rooms; a guest in an unfamiliar city, especially late at night, has limited options if something goes wrong.

**Verification asymmetry:** The guest is being asked to open the door immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the person outside is a current, on-duty employee of the hotel.

**Photo catches substitution:** The verification response includes a `photo_url` field. A badge may verify as "ON-DUTY" but the face at the door doesn't match the photo on record — that catches the scenario where someone borrows or steals a colleague's badge. Staff scanning through a peephole or doorbell camera can compare the face before opening.

**Verification protects the worker too.** Hotel staff — particularly housekeeping and room-service workers — are vulnerable to false accusations from guests: theft claims, inappropriate-conduct complaints, or allegations that the worker entered uninvited. A verified interaction log with a timestamp proves the worker was legitimately on-duty and assigned to that floor, providing contemporaneous evidence if a dispute arises later.

*The server rotates the salt — after each successful scan (burn-on-verify) or on TTL expiry of an unscanned salt — and the badge re-renders to match. The screen is always in lockstep with the salt the server will honour, so a photograph is worthless unless verified in the moment. See [E-Ink ID Cards](../e-ink-id-cards.md) for how this prevents cloning and tracking.*

## Data Verified

Staff name, photo (hash), employee ID, job role (e.g., Housekeeping, Maintenance, Room Service), property affiliation, current duty status (Active/Off-Duty), background check clearance date (hash).

**Document Types:**
- **Employee ID Badge:** Carried by the staff member.
- **Service Work Order:** (Digital or paper) proving the authorized room visit.
- **Airbnb Host ID:** (Digital) for vacation rental check-ins.
- **Contractor Permit:** For outside vendors (e.g., plumbers) working in the hotel.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Staff member is currently working and authorized to enter guest areas
- **OFF_DUTY** — Shift ended; staff should not be in guest corridors
- **SUSPENDED** — Access revoked due to safety or disciplinary review; do not admit
- **INVALID** — Badge reported lost or serial mismatch
- **404** — Badge not found (forged, terminated employee, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `ids.hilton.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, guests may record the interaction:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

--- Optional Follow-Up ---

You may record details of this staff interaction.
You will NEVER be told not to do this or that it is not needed.

POST to: https://hilton.com/guest-feedback/staff/9k2m4x8p

Fields:
- Room number (optional)
- Service type: [Room Service / Housekeeping / Maintenance / Other]
- Service quality: [Excellent / Good / Concerns]
- Any concerns or issues?
- Request manager callback? [Y/N]
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Pattern detection:** Staff receiving frequent "concerns" across multiple guests triggers review
- **Incident correlation:** If something goes missing from a room, there's a record of who entered
- **Quality improvement:** Management sees which staff consistently get positive feedback
- **Guest empowerment:** Recording is always welcomed, never discouraged

**The "Never Discouraged" Principle:**

Staff should never tell guests "don't bother" or "that's not necessary." Every report is logged. The hotel can triage later—but the guest is never made to feel their input isn't wanted.

## Second-Party Use

The **Hotel Staff Member** benefits from verification.

**Professional Safety:** Proving to a frightened or suspicious guest that they are a legitimate employee. Verification reduces the chance of "Panic Alarms" or aggressive confrontations when a staff member enters a room for authorized service.

**Access to High-Security Floors:** Proving their verified identity to an automated elevator or lounge system to access restricted executive areas.

## Third-Party Use

**Hotel Guests (Travelers)**
**Assault Prevention:** Before opening the door at 11 PM for a "Maintenance" person, a guest can ask to see the badge through the peephole or doorbell camera. Scanning the hash confirms the person is a "Verified On-Duty" employee of the hotel, preventing "Fake Uniform" home-invasion style attacks.

**Automated Doorbell Authentication:** In time, room-door cameras could autonomously authenticate the worker by scanning the badge as they approach. The system could then announce the verified status via a nearby intercom or the guest's mobile device ("Authorized Maintenance at the door"), providing immediate assurance before the guest even reaches the door—though other proximity technologies like Bluetooth or NFC could also achieve similar results.

**Vacation Rental Guests (Airbnb)**
**Host Vetting:** Instantly verifying the identity of a host during a "Key Handoff" in an unfamiliar city, ensuring the person isn't a scammer.

**Hotel Security Directors**
**Audit Integrity:** Ensuring that only background-checked and active employees are present in guest wings, identifying "Ghost Employees" or terminated staff using old badges.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Service" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Burglars buying realistic-looking "Marriott Housekeeping" uniforms and fake ID lanyards online to gain entry into rooms when guests are out (or in).
- **Credential Hiding:** A terminated employee keeping their physical card to maintain access to high-value areas.
- **Host Impersonation:** Scammers posing as "Property Managers" for Airbnb rentals to steal guest luggage or demand cash payments.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Hotel Chains:** (Hilton, Marriott, Accor, Hyatt).
**Vacation Rental Platforms:** (Airbnb, Vrbo).
**Facility Management Firms:** (e.g., Compass Group, Sodexo).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Staff locations and names are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Stalking" attacks where someone tries to track a specific employee's movements through a building.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Hotel employers issue staff badges verifying employee status. The issuer is self-authorized as the employer responsible for guest safety.

```
✓ staff.marriott.co.uk/verify — Verifies hotel staff employment status and duty clearance
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the hotel's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (employee ID, job role, duty status, clearance date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the staff badge issuance and access audit trail.


## Competition vs. Uniforms / Peepholes

| Feature | Live Verify | Uniform & Name Tag | Calling the Front Desk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Brand. | **Visual.** Trusted via logo only. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to status. | **Zero.** Uniforms are easily faked. | **Variable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan through peephole. | **N/A.** Just looking. | **Slow.** Often takes 5+ minutes to reach a rep. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if banned *today*. | **Static.** | **N/A.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Doorstep Workflow." Guests make the decision to open the door in seconds. They don't want to engage in a long phone conversation while a stranger stands in the hallway. Live Verify turns the **ID Badge** into a live, non-confrontational safety tool that provides instant, high-authority trust.

## Adoption Nuances: Practical Considerations for Hotels

**For hotel chains evaluating implementation:**

**Badge Replacement Logistics:** You have old plastic badges in circulation. You need a *sunset policy*—plastic badges stop working on Date X. Without it, guests see both types and won't understand which is real. Budget 3-6 months for staff transition; shorter timelines create confusion.

**Guest Training:** Not all guests carry phones or understand OCR. Some will ask staff to scan for them (defeats the purpose). Budget signage ("Scan our badges using the hotel app") and guest education.

**Contractor Complexity:** Housekeeping, maintenance, laundry, and food service contractors work multiple hotels. They won't want separate badges per hotel. Provide lanyards, centralized distribution, or contractual solutions to reduce friction.

**Turnover Reality:** 50% annual turnover? Badge reprinting is normal ops. 10% turnover? Distribution burden is minimal. Know your baseline before budgeting.

**Implementation Timeline:** 6-10 months for hotels (simpler than healthcare/police because fewer regulatory constraints and no officer safety paradox).
