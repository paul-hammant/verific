## What are Safety Certifications?

For any manufactured product—especially electronics, toys, and building materials—a **Safety Certification** (like a UL Listing or a CE Mark) is the proof that the item won't catch fire, explode, or leach toxins. These certifications are issued by independent labs after rigorous testing against thousands of pages of safety codes.

These documents are the "Entry Permit" for global commerce. US Customs, Amazon, and Walmart will not sell or import a product unless it has a verified **Certificate of Compliance (CoC)**. Fraud is a massive global issue: factories in unregulated regions often place fake "UL" or "CE" labels on un-tested, dangerous products to save on testing costs. Verified hashes bind the **Product Model, Testing Standard, and Lab ID** to the certifying body's domain (e.g., `ul.com` or `intertek.com`).

## Data Verified

Certificate number, manufacturer name, factory location ID, product model name/number, specific safety standards met (e.g., UL 60950), date of issuance, expiration date (if applicable), testing lab ID, follow-up service (FUS) status, signing engineer name.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Compliance (CoC):** The summary for retailers/customs.
- **Listing Report (Full):** The multi-page technical test data.
- **Factory Inspection Report:** Proof the factory itself is audited.
- **Mark Authorization:** Permission to print the "UL" or "CE" logo.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ul.com`, `intertek.com`, `tuv.com`) and the listing standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Listed / Verified** — Product is current and in full safety compliance.
- **Withdrawn** — **CRITICAL:** The listing has been cancelled (e.g., due to failed factory audit).
- **Recalled** — **CRITICAL:** Product has a safety defect; stop use immediately.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The certification period has passed; re-testing required.

### Scope enrichment: what the certificate actually covers

A certificate is authentic and yet still be *over-applied* — a genuine cert for a small tested run
waved through a far larger untested production run, or a cert for one model reused for a variant it
never covered. Binding the model and standard into the hash defeats *editing* the certificate; it does
not, on its own, tell a buyer whether the unit **in their hands** falls within what the cert covers.

Because a safety certificate carries no personal data, the certifying body can safely **echo the scope
of the certificate on verification** — the accountability facts the terse label had no room for. On a
successful lookup, `ul.com`/`intertek.com` may return:

```json
{
  "status": "verified",
  "certificate": "UL-2026-992288",
  "model": "XJ-9922",
  "standards": ["UL 62368-1", "CAN/CSA C22.2", "IEC 60950-1"],
  "run_covered": "LOT-2026-8844",
  "run_size_certified": "up to 500,000 units",
  "run_scope_note": "certification covers this production run; units beyond the certified quantity, or after retest_due, are not covered by this certificate",
  "tested_on": "2026-03-15",
  "retest_due": "2027-03-15",
  "labs": ["verify:labtest-shenzhen.example/reports"],
  "more": "https://ul.com/v/UL-2026-992288"
}
```

This lets the buyer answer the questions that matter and the label could not carry:

- **Is my unit in scope?** `run_covered` + `run_size_certified` make the covered run and quantity
  explicit — so a buyer can see that unit 800,000 of a run certified "up to 500,000" is *outside* the
  certificate, even though the certificate itself verifies.
- **Is the PASS still current?** `tested_on` + `retest_due` surface the point-in-time nature of the
  result — a certificate past its retest date is stale even when it looks fine (see
  [point-in-time vs current](../../docs/point-in-time-vs-current.md)).
- **What was actually tested?** The exact standards the samples met — so a cert for one standard cannot
  be read as covering a stricter one it never addressed.

This is a **model case of safe enrichment**: no personal data, and every field *reveals scope the terse
claim withheld* rather than repeating it (see
[verification-enrichment-hazards.md](../../docs/verification-enrichment-hazards.md) for when enrichment
is legitimate). The certifier discloses only accountability facts it is entitled to publish; the effect
is to stop a genuine, narrow certificate being over-read as a blanket guarantee — which is the core
mechanism of certificate-scope fraud.

## Second-Party Use

The **Manufacturer / Importer** benefits from verification.

**Retailer Approval:** To get a product onto Amazon or Target, the importer provides the verified hash of their safety certificate. The retailer's "Automated Compliance Bot" scans the hash and instantly confirms the listing is real, removing the 2-week delay of manual lab-record checks.

**Insurance Underwriting:** Manufacturers can use verified hashes of their "Low-Risk" safety history to negotiate lower product liability premiums, proving their commitment to engineering standards with cryptographic certainty.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs & Border Protection (CBP)**
**Anti-Counterfeit Vetting:** In a busy port, an officer scans the label on a crate of lithium batteries. If the hash returns **"NOT FOUND"** or **"DOMAIN MISMATCH,"** they can seize the shipment immediately, stopping dangerous un-tested electronics from entering the market.

**Fire Marshals / Safety Inspectors**
**Field Integrity:** During a building inspection, the marshal scans the "Verified" stickers on the electrical panels or commercial kitchen equipment. Live Verify ensures the equipment hasn't been "Fake Labeled" to hide a lack of certification.

**Amazon / E-commerce Platforms**
**Merchant Accountability:** Automatically de-listing any seller whose verified safety hash returns a **"RECALLED"** or **"WITHDRAWN"** status, protecting customers from exploding chargers or toxic toys.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Label" Fraud Problem**

- **Standard Padding:** Printing a "UL Listed" logo on a product that was never tested by UL.
- **Model Masking:** Using a valid certificate for a "Safe" model to cover for a "Cheaper, Dangerous" model.
- **Lab Spoofing:** Creating a fake "CoC" from a non-existent testing lab with a fraudulent website.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs) like UL, Intertek.**
**European Notified Bodies (for CE Marks).**
**National Standards Bureaus (e.g., NIST, ANSI).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Safety certifications are public safety data by necessity. However, individual factory IDs and production batch volumes should be salted to protect manufacturing trade secrets.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Safety testing laboratories are accredited by product safety authorities to verify that manufactured products meet rigorous safety standards before entering commerce.

```
✓ certs.ul.com/verify — Issues verified product safety certifications
  ✓ opss.gov.uk — Enforces UK product safety standards
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Product safety is the "Invisible Foundation" of modern life. By turning static labels into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that the "Protection" on the box is backed by the professional truth of the lab, preventing fires and saving lives.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
