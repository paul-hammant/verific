## What is a Filing Completion Receipt?

A filing completion receipt confirms that a required document, form, or registration was submitted to an authority by a specific deadline. These receipts prove compliance with legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations. Missing a filing deadline can result in penalties, license revocations, or legal consequences.

Filing receipt fraud includes fake receipts to claim timely submission when deadlines were missed, or altered receipts to hide late filings.

## Data Verified

Receiving authority, filing type, filer name/entity, filing date and time, confirmation number, acceptance status, any fees paid.

**Document Types:**
- **Tax Filing Receipt:** Federal, state, or local tax returns.
- **Securities Filing:** SEC EDGAR, state blue sky filings.
- **Corporate Annual Report:** State secretary of state filings.
- **Permit Application:** Building, zoning, environmental permits.
- **Regulatory Report:** Industry-specific compliance filings.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`irs.gov`, `sec.gov`, `corp.delaware.gov`) and filing status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Accepted** — Filing received and accepted by the authority.
- **Pending Review** — Received but not yet processed.
- **Rejected** — Filing rejected for errors, requires resubmission.
- **Amended** — Original filing superseded by amendment.
- **Late** — Filed after deadline (penalties may apply).

## Second-Party Use

The **Filer** benefits from verification.

**Deadline Proof:** When penalties are assessed for alleged late filing, verified receipts prove timely submission.

**Audit Defense:** During tax audits, verified filing receipts prove returns were submitted as claimed.

**Insurance Coverage:** Some policies require proof of regulatory compliance. Verified receipts satisfy policy conditions.

**Contractual Compliance:** Business contracts often require proof of regulatory filings. Verified receipts provide that proof.

## Third-Party Use

**Auditors / Accountants**
**Compliance Verification:** Auditors verify that required filings were made on time as part of financial statement audits.

**Lenders**
**Covenant Compliance:** Loan covenants often require timely regulatory filings. Verified receipts prove compliance.

**Investors**
**Due Diligence:** Before investing, verified filing history shows the company maintains regulatory compliance.

**Regulators**
**Cross-Reference:** One agency verifying filings with another (e.g., state verifying federal tax compliance).

**Insurance Companies**
**Coverage Conditions:** D&O insurance may require verified proof of regulatory filings for claims.

## Verification Architecture

**The Filing Receipt Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Receipts:** Forged receipts claiming filings that were never made.
- **Date Alteration:** Changing filing dates to appear compliant when deadlines were missed.
- **Confirmation Number Invention:** Made-up confirmation numbers for non-existent filings.
- **Status Misrepresentation:** Claiming "Accepted" when filing was actually rejected.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Federal Agencies:** (IRS, SEC, EPA, OSHA) federal regulatory filings.
**State Agencies:** (Secretary of State, Tax Departments, Licensing Boards).
**Local Government:** (City, County) permits and local filings.
**Courts:** (Bankruptcy, Civil) legal filings.
**International:** (HMRC UK, CRA Canada) foreign tax authorities.

**Timestamp Integrity**

Filing deadlines are often strict to the minute. Verified receipts should include precise timestamps that can prove timely submission even when the deadline is close.

**Amendment Tracking**

Original filings may be amended. Verified receipts should indicate whether the filing is original or an amendment, and link to prior versions.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Companies House issues filing receipts and completion confirmations under the Companies Act 2006.

```
✓ companieshouse.gov.uk/filing/verify — Companies House filing receipt and completion service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the government agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (filing number, filing date, document type, submission status) — never filer name, filing details, or personal information — providing non-repudiation of the filing completion receipt issuance and immutable proof of submission timestamp.
