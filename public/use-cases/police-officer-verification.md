## The Threshold Moment

It is midnight. A loud knock. Through the peephole, a stranger claiming to be a police officer. In that split-second window — open the door or not, comply or not — a citizen has to make a safety decision they cannot take back, and they have to make it *now*, not after ten minutes on hold with a dispatch centre while someone is banging on the door. This is the **threshold moment**, and it is the same moment in a traffic stop by an unmarked vehicle: **"Is this person actually a law enforcement officer?"**

Live Verify resolves it through [dual-channel trust](../../docs/dual-channel-trust.md) — two checks that land at the same instant. The citizen reads the plain-text claim on the officer's badge (a name, a rank, and a `vfy:` line), and *their own judgement* runs the **human channel**: "`met.police.uk` — that's a real police domain; if this checks out, I'm safer," versus balking at "`realpoliceverified.com` — that's not government, I don't trust that." At the same moment their phone runs the **machine channel**: it walks the [authority chain](../../docs/authority-chain-app-display.md) from the department's domain up to a [sovereign root](../../docs/sovereign-roots.md), cryptographically proving which jurisdiction stands behind the badge — in under a second. When the gut read and the proof click into place together, a sovereign government stands behind the person on the porch.

Criminals frequently use fake badges, uniforms, and dashboard lights to impersonate officers. Even legitimate officers may sometimes be under suspension or have had their authority revoked. And with **burn-on-verify** badges (see [E-Ink ID Cards](../e-ink-id-cards.md)), a photograph of a credential is worthless seconds after it is taken — the credential the citizen verifies must be live, in the moment.

Live Verify allows a citizen to scan the officer's ID card to get a real-time "Authenticated" status directly from the department's official domain (e.g., `nypd.gov` or `met.police.uk`), without requiring the officer to divulge personal home addresses or private details.

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the citizen's perspective. The traffic stop or home visit is initiated by the officer.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The officer can detain, search, arrest, or compel compliance — consequences a citizen cannot safely ignore or resist in the moment.

**Verification asymmetry:** The citizen is being asked to comply immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the officer is a current, authorized member of the force they claim to represent.

**Verification protects the officer too.** Officers face false impersonation complaints ("that person wasn't a real officer"), fabricated misconduct allegations, and "sovereign citizen" challenges to their authority. A verified interaction log — timestamped and authority-chained to the department's domain — provides contemporaneous proof that the officer was genuine, on-duty, and authorized at the time and place of the encounter. This is exoneration evidence, not just citizen protection.

**Verification by Visual Inspection:**
When presented with a physical warrant card, a citizen must rely on visual inspection and prior familiarity with authentic police credentials. This requires recognizing the issuing department's logo, layout, typography, and photo authenticity—all of which are difficult without specialized training and easily forged.

  </div>
</div>

*The server rotates the salt — after each successful verification (burn-on-verify) or on TTL expiry of an unscanned salt — and the badge re-renders to match. The screen is always in lockstep with the salt the server will honour, so a photograph is worthless unless verified in the moment. See [E-Ink ID Cards](../e-ink-id-cards.md) for how this prevents cloning and the "photograph and dox" attack.*

### Digital Warrant Card (Mobile Phone - Backup)

Officers also carry a secure mobile app that generates the same verifiable display. This serves as a backup if the physical badge is damaged, lost, or for plainclothes officers who do not wear a lanyard but need to prove authority upon request. Here's a phone's display in landscape mode (optimized for verifyer's camera pictire clarity):

<div style="max-width: 570px; margin: 24px auto; border: 12px solid #333; border-radius: 30px; background: #fff; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

**Security Features:**
- **Exact Parity:** The app generates the *exact same hash* as the e-ink badge for the currently displayed salt, and re-renders alongside it when a scan consumes that salt.
- **High-Contrast Mode:** Designed with pure black text on white background to ensure 100% OCR accuracy even in low light or through a car window.
- **Biometric Unlock:** Officer must FaceID/fingerprint to preventing unauthorized use of a lost phone.
- **Cloning Protection:** The server rotates the salt one minute after each successful scan (burn-on-verify), or on TTL expiry if the badge is never scanned, and the badge re-renders both times. A photographed copy is worthless unless verified the instant the photo is taken — by the time anyone tries the captured hash, the server and the badge have moved on.
- **Location Verification:** The verification display shows a map of the officer's current location, which the verifier can confirm matches where they are.
- **Real-time Status:** If an officer is suspended or the card is stolen, the e-ink display shows nothing; verification returns invalid.

**Verification Workflow:**
A citizen reads the e-ink card, then uses their iPhone or Android camera app to verify it instantly against the issuer's domain.

**Officer Privacy & Safety:**
The rotating salt creates **ephemeral, non-persistent identifiers**.
- **No Tracking:** Unlike static hashes that could be logged to track an officer's movement (e.g., "Badge 1332 seen in Brixton at 2pm, Peckham at 3pm"), the rotating salt stops this possibility. The hash changes constantly.
- **No Historical Doxing:** Expired hashes return `404 Not Found`. A bad actor cannot query old hashes to build a dossier on an officer.

## Privacy-First Architecture

The system is designed to verify **authority**, not just identity. This protects officers from harassment while ensuring citizens can trust the person in front of them.

**The Verification Claim:**

The dynamic system verifies:

> "Active duty officer, Metropolitan Police, authorized for traffic enforcement."

**How it works:**

1. **Warrant Card:** Displays "PC Alex D" + Photo (for visual ID).
2. **Verification:** Returns "Valid Officer, London Met, Traffic Division".
3. **Result:** The citizen knows the officer is real and authorized, but the specific private data needed for "doxing" or harassment remains protected.

**Undercover & Special Operations:**

This mobile phone version allows plainclothes or undercover officers to verify their authority to a citizen (e.g., during a stop) without revealing their full identity or task force assignment, which could compromise ongoing operations.

## When to Verify

**Appropriate Contexts:**

- **Consent Searches:** Officer requests permission to search property.
- **Warrant Service:** Officer claims to have a warrant.
- **Investigative Interviews:** Non-emergency questioning at your door or in public.
- **Incident Response:** Reporting a past crime or non-emergency situation.
- **Traffic Stops:** When conditions allow (e.g., safe location, non-aggressive encounter).

**Inappropriate Contexts:**

- **Active Emergencies:** "Shots fired," medical emergencies, or chasing a suspect.
- **Immediate Threat:** Officer is securing a volatile scene or protecting life.
- **Urgent Compliance:** When instant action is required for safety.

**Guidance:** Verification is a tool for accountability during *controlled* interactions. It should never delay response to life-threatening emergencies.

## Value to Parties

**The Citizen:**
- **Safety:** Confirms the person stopping them is a real officer, not an impersonator.
- **Confidence:** "Verified" status with a current department photo reduces anxiety and encourages cooperation.
- **Record:** Creates a timestamped, verified log of the encounter's legitimacy.

**The Police Department:**
- **Trust:** Demonstrates a commitment to transparency and modern accountability.
- **Officer Safety:** Protects officers' personal data better than traditional name-heavy badges.
- **Fraud Prevention:** Makes stolen or fake badges useless.
- **Streamlining ID challenges:** [This convoluted (UK Met Police) identification process](https://www.met.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/fa/how-to-check-an-officers-identity/) goes away.

**The Legal System:**
- **Audit Trail:** Provides undeniable proof that a specific officer (identified by hash) was present and authorized at the time of an arrest or search.

## Implementation Requirements

**Privacy-Protective Architecture:**
To gain officer adoption, the system must anonymize the verification result. The claim should focus on *rank, role, and active status*, minimizing the exposure of personal details that could be used for harassment.

**Rotating Salt Infrastructure:**
Departments must implement the backend logic to generate and validate rotating salts. This requires:
1.  **Mobile App:** Officers' phones sync salts to their e-ink badges via Bluetooth.
2.  **Transient Registry:** A backend service that tracks *currently valid* salt/badge pairs, rather than a permanent database of static hashes.
3.  **Expiration Logic:** Hashes must strictly expire to prevent historical tracking.

## Further Derivations

1. **Federal Law Enforcement:** FBI, ATF, DEA agents with multi-jurisdictional authority. Higher secrecy requirements necessitate strict privacy controls.
2. **Plainclothes/Undercover:** Officers working vice, narcotics, or organized crime who need to prove authority without blowing their cover identity.

## Related E-Ink Scenarios

The "Mobile Service Staff in Ungated Facilities" pattern is also used to protect citizens and staff in these contexts:

- [Mobile Service Staff (Hotels)](view.html?doc=hotel-staff-verification) — Guests verify staff before opening doors.
- [Delivery & Courier Verification](view.html?doc=delivery-courier-verification) — Recipients verify delivery persons.
- [Healthcare Facility Staff](view.html?doc=healthcare-facility-staff) — Patients verify staff in hospitals.
- [Residential Building Staff](view.html?doc=residential-building-staff) — Residents verify maintenance/contractors.
- [Event Venue & Contractor Staff](view.html?doc=event-venue-staff) — Security and staff verify contractors.

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, the response includes a verification ID that serves both citizen accountability and officer protection:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

--- For Your Records ---
You verified an active Metropolitan Police officer.
Verification ID: VRF-2026-01-12-14:32:07-7k3m9x2p
This verification has been logged by the department.

If you have concerns about this encounter:
https://met.police.uk/complaints?ref=VRF-2026-01-12-14:32:07-7k3m9x2p
```

**What This Enables:**

**For Citizens:**
- **One-click complaint path** — Verification ID pre-filled; no need to remember badge numbers
- **Timestamp proof** — Proves verification happened at the time, not fabricated later
- **Context preserved** — Department can look up which officer's salt was active at that moment

**For Officers:**
- **Harassment pattern detection** — Management can identify "auditor" behaviour: same person verifying multiple officers repeatedly, verification attempts immediately followed by complaints, coordinated verification campaigns
- **Frivolous complaint filtering** — Complaints linked to verifications can be cross-referenced; patterns emerge ("this complainant filed 47 complaints this month, all immediately after verification")
- **Exoneration evidence** — Officer can prove they were verified (and thus displayed valid credentials) at a specific time and place

**For the Department:**
- **Correlation analytics** — "Officer X had 200 verifications this month, 2 complaints" vs "Officer Y had 50 verifications, 15 complaints"
- **Abuse detection** — Identify individuals using verification as a harassment tool rather than legitimate safety check
- **Accountability audit trail** — Every verification logged; no POST form required from citizen

**Why No POST Form:**

Unlike building inspectors or healthcare workers, police verification doesn't use a "record this interaction" POST form:

| Use Case | POST Form? | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Building inspector | Yes | Low risk of weaponization; homeowner rarely sees same inspector twice |
| Healthcare worker | Yes | Patient/family relationship is ongoing; staffing evidence benefits workers |
| Police officer | No | High risk of weaponization by "auditors"; verification itself is sufficient record |

The verification event IS the record. The department already has it. A POST form would invite frivolous reports without adding accountability value.

**The Verification ID Balances Power:**

- Citizen has proof and a complaint path → accountability
- Department has verification logs and pattern detection → officer protection
- Neither side can abuse the system without leaving a trail

## Rationale

Citizen safety is the primary driver. Domain binding verifies the department (police.gov, sheriff.gov). It bridges the gap between the physical presence of an officer and the digital record of their authority, enhancing public trust and police accountability while respecting officer safety needs.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the police department's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (officer ID, rank, department, shift status) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the officer's current active status and authority.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Police forces hold statutory authority under police law to issue warrant cards and verify active officer status.

```
✓ warrant.police.uk/verify — Issues warrant cards and verifies officer authority
```

Self-authorized — this is a sovereign body whose authority derives from statute.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.
