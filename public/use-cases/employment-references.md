## What is an Employment Reference?

A verified employment reference proves you actually worked somewhere. It can appear as an addendum to a CV/resume, in an email after a job offer, or as a standalone VOE letter.

Fraud is common: "Reference Mills" sell fake employment letters. Live Verify connects the verifier directly to the real employer's domain.

## Data Verified

Employee name, legal employer name, job title/role, start date, end date (or "Present"), rehire eligibility status, reason for departure (voluntary/involuntary), salary (optional/linked hash), HRIS reference ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Verification of Employment (VOE):** Standard 1-page form.
- **Reference Letter:** Narrative letter from a supervisor.
- **Experience Certificate:** (Common in India/Middle East).
- **Separation Notice:** Final proof of departure.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`acme-corp.com`, `workday.com`) and current worker standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Record matches the company's official HRIS file.
- **Revoked** — Reference withdrawn (e.g., discovery of post-departure misconduct).
- **Superseded** — Replaced by a corrected version (e.g., date correction).
- **Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** Reference ID associated with a known "Reference Mill."

## Second-Party Use

The **Employee (Applicant)** benefits from verification.

**Background Check Speed:** Proving their work history instantly to a new employer. A verified hash allows the recruiter to skip the "Manual Phone Tag" with HR departments, reducing the time-to-hire from 10 days to 10 seconds.

**Mortgage Approval:** Proving income stability to a lender. Banks often reject VOE letters if the phone number on the letterhead doesn't match a Google search. A verified hash from the corporate domain removes this doubt.

## Third-Party Use

**Hiring Managers / Recruiters**
**Fraud Prevention:** Nanny/Reference mills sell fake employment letters for a fee. Live Verify connects the recruiter directly to the real employer's domain, stopping "Fake Resume" fraud at the source.

**Background Check Firms (Checkr / Sterling)**
**Automation:** Firms can use the verification hash to automatically clear employment history checks, significantly lowering their manual labor costs.

**Immigration Authorities**
**Work Visa Vetting:** Verifying the "Specialty Occupation" claims of an H-1B or L-1 applicant by confirming their prior job titles and duties against the employer's verified record.

## Peer References

Unlike formal VOE letters from HR departments, **peer references** are colleague-to-colleague attestations—similar to LinkedIn recommendations but cryptographically verifiable. See [prior art discussion of mine](https://gist.github.com/paul-hammant/3375fec8e204f0c7567d4daea1fe48ef).

The verify URL points to the *referee's* domain, not the employer's. This reflects that the claim is personal ("I worked with this person") rather than institutional ("This person was employed here").

**Infrastructure reality:** Peer references are self-certified. The referee stands up hashes on their own domain — potentially a static site, a GitHub Pages folder, or a personal server. This is the opposite end of the spectrum from a high-availability vault used by banks or government identity systems. The trust model is correspondingly lighter: you're trusting the individual's domain, not an institution's infrastructure. That's the point — it's deliberately low-barrier, allowing anyone to make verifiable attestations without institutional backing.

<div verifiable-text-element="true" style="max-width: 550px; margin: 24px auto; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; background: #f9f9f9; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #999; font-size: 1em; color: #000; line-height: 1.6; position: relative;">
  I, Paul Hammant, worked for Kevin Behr in<br>
  his role as CIO of HedgeServ in New York City<br>
  in 2015 and 2016<br>
  <span data-verify-line="peer-ref">verify:paulhammant.com/refs</span>
</div>

**Use Cases:**
- **Professional Networking:** A former colleague attests to working with you, verifiable against their personal site.
- **Freelance/Contract Work:** When no formal HR department exists, peers can vouch for project collaboration.
- **Reference Chains:** Multiple peer attestations from different people build a web of trust.

## Academic Recommendation Letters

The same peer-reference pattern applies to academic recommendations — and at much higher volume.

A professor writes a recommendation letter for a student applying to graduate school, a scholarship, or a faculty position. The letter is currently a PDF or email attachment. The admissions committee has no way to verify it was actually written by the named professor — they trust the letterhead, the email address, or the submission platform.

**The fabrication problem is growing.** AI can generate convincing recommendation letters. A student who fabricates a letter from a professor who never taught them — or who edits a genuine letter to strengthen it — faces no technical barrier. The admissions committee reads it at face value.

A verifiable recommendation follows the same model as the peer reference above: the professor issues the claim from their own domain.

<div style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; max-width: 550px; margin: 24px auto; background: #f9f9f9; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #999; font-size: 1em; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;">
  <span verifiable-text="start" data-for="acadref"></span>
  I, Professor Sarah Chen, recommend
  James Williams for admission to the
  MSc Computer Science programme.
  I supervised his final-year project
  at the University of York, 2025-2026.
  <span data-verify-line="acadref">verify:sarahchen.ac.uk/recommendations</span>
  <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="acadref"></span>
</div>

The verify URL points to the **professor's** domain, not the university's. The claim is personal: "I recommend this person." The university didn't write it; the professor did.

**Institutional vs. personal attestation:**

| Type | Issuer | Domain | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Employment VOE | HR department | `acme-corp.com/staff` | "This person worked here" |
| Employment peer reference | Individual colleague | `paulhammant.com/refs` | "I worked with this person" |
| Academic recommendation | Individual professor | `sarahchen.ac.uk/recommendations` | "I recommend this person" |
| Academic transcript | University registrar | `york.ac.uk/transcripts` | "This person earned these grades" |

The first and last are institutional. The middle two are personal. Live Verify handles both, but the trust model is different: an institutional claim carries the institution's reputation; a personal claim carries the individual's.

**Where this matters most:**
- Graduate school admissions (millions of letters per year globally)
- Scholarship applications (high-value, competitive)
- Faculty hiring and tenure review (career-defining)
- Professional programme applications (medicine, law, MBA)
- Post-doctoral and research positions

**What it does NOT replace:** the content of the recommendation. The verified claim proves the professor actually wrote and published this letter. It does not prove the letter's claims about the student are true — that remains the professor's professional judgment and reputation.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Reference Mill" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Letters:** Entirely fake companies (with real-looking websites) providing fake references for a fee.
- **Title Inflation:** Changing "Junior Intern" to "Senior Lead" on a PDF to get a higher salary at a new job.
- **Date Stretching:** Altering a 3-month tenure to look like a 3-year tenure.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Corporations:** (e.g., Google, Amazon, local SMBs).
**HRIS Platforms:** (Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, ADP).
**Verification Utilities:** (The Work Number / Equifax).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Employment data is sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guessing" names of employees to see their departure reasons.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

```
✓ hr.example-corp.com/references/verify — Provides employment references for current and former staff
```

No regulatory chain. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the employer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (employee name, employment dates, job title, HRIS reference ID) — never salary, rehire status details, or termination reasons — providing non-repudiation of the employment reference issuance.


## Competition vs. The Work Number (Equifax)

| Feature | Live Verify | The Work Number | Manual Phone Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Employee controls the document share. | **Low.** Lenders see full historical data pool. | **Medium.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Employer. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any company with a URL. | **Limited.** Only for large firms who pay for TWN. | **Universal.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Lenders pay $50-$100 per check. | **High.** Costs in human time. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Reach. Small and medium businesses (SMBs) aren't on The Work Number. They rely on "Persistent Paper" reference letters. Live Verify allows a small 5-person law firm or a local bakery to provide the same level of cryptographic trust as a Fortune 500 company.

## Mandate Potential

Employment references and VOE letters are strong candidates for a **government-mandated free verification** obligation. Employers already hold employment data in payroll and HRIS systems; a mandate to offer hash-based verification endpoints would impose minimal marginal cost on existing infrastructure.

**Why mandate makes sense here:**
- Employers are already required to report payroll data to tax authorities (HMRC/PAYE in the UK, IRS/W-2 in the US). Mandating a verification endpoint is a small incremental obligation on top of existing reporting duties.
- The current alternative — The Work Number (Equifax) — charges $50-100 per lookup and only covers large employers. A mandate would democratise employment verification, making it free and universal rather than a paid service gatekept by a data aggregator.
- Employment verification delays are a systemic drag on mortgage approvals, rental applications, and hiring pipelines. Mandated verification endpoints would collapse multi-day manual processes into seconds.
- Employees currently depend on their former employer's goodwill to get a timely reference. A mandate gives the employee a **right** to a verifiable confirmation, with a time-limited salt they control.

**Implementation path:** Tax authorities (HMRC, IRS) could require that any employer filing payroll returns must also operate a Live Verify endpoint (or delegate to their payroll provider — Workday, ADP, Sage, Xero — who would offer it as a standard feature). Small employers using basic payroll software would get verification hosting bundled in, just as they currently get RTI/PAYE filing bundled in.
