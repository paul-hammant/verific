## What is a Search Warrant?

A **Search Warrant** is a judicial authorization permitting law enforcement to search a specific place, person, or thing for specific items connected to a crime. In the United States, the Fourth Amendment requires warrants to be issued by a judge upon a showing of probable cause. Equivalent protections exist in virtually every democracy: the UK's Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 7), Canada's Criminal Code (s.487).

The core problem: **the person being searched has no practical way to verify the warrant is real.**

A search warrant is a piece of paper with a judge's signature — or, increasingly, a PDF displayed on an officer's phone. Both are trivially forged. The subject must comply immediately or face obstruction charges. Challenging a fake warrant after the fact means the damage is already done: property tossed, devices seized, privacy destroyed. And if the warrant was fabricated by a corrupt officer, a criminal impersonating police, or a state actor targeting a dissident — the victim has no recourse in the moment.

Court and law-enforcement warrant systems should remain primary for officers, clerks, and prosecutors. The strong Live Verify case is different: the subject of the search, landlord, or tech company often has no practical access to those systems even though they are the ones being confronted with the document.

## Data Verified

Court jurisdiction, case number, issuing judge, address/location authorized for search, items/categories authorized for seizure, date of issuance, expiration date and time, time-of-day restrictions (daytime only vs. nighttime authorization), executing agency, any special conditions (no-knock authorization, nighttime execution permission, scope limitations).

**Document Types:**
- **Search Warrant** — Standard authorization to search premises, vehicles, or containers for evidence
- **Arrest Warrant** — Judicial authorization to take a specific person into custody
- **Seizure/Forfeiture Warrant** — Authorization to seize specific property as evidence or for civil forfeiture
- **Electronic Search Warrant** — Authorization to search digital devices, email accounts, cloud storage, or compel tech companies to produce data
- **Warrant Return/Inventory** — Post-execution record filed with the court documenting exactly what was seized

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a status code reflecting the warrant's current state:

- **ACTIVE** — Warrant is valid, issued by the named judge, not yet executed or expired. The scope shown matches the court record.
- **EXECUTED** — Search has been completed. A warrant return has been filed. (If the return itself carries a verify line, the response may link to it.)
- **EXPIRED** — The warrant's time limit passed without execution. It can no longer be used to authorize a search.
- **QUASHED** — The issuing judge (or a higher court) has withdrawn the warrant. It is void.
- **SEALED** — A warrant exists and is authentic, but its details are sealed by court order. This confirms the document is real without revealing its scope — critical for ongoing investigations.
- **404** — Warrant not found. The document is forged, the case number is wrong, or OCR failed.

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the warrant itself (e.g., `warrants.uscourts.gov`).

## Post-Verification Actions

Unlike most use cases, search warrants have a meaningful post-verification chain: the **warrant return**.

After executing a search, law enforcement must file an inventory of everything seized with the issuing court within a specified period (typically 10 days in federal cases). This return could itself carry a verify line, creating a verifiable chain:

**Warrant → Return → Evidence Log**

Each link is independently verifiable. A defense attorney can confirm that the warrant was valid at the time of execution, that the return was timely filed, and that the inventory matches what was actually taken. This chain is the foundation of evidence integrity for everything seized — if any link is broken, suppression motions follow.

## Second-Party Use

The **subject of the search** — the homeowner, business owner, tenant, or individual whose property or person is being searched.

**Verifying the warrant is real:** When officers arrive at the door, the subject scans the verify line. ACTIVE confirms it's genuine. 404 means it's forged — call 911. This is the most time-critical verification in the entire Live Verify ecosystem: the subject has seconds, not hours.

**Verifying the scope:** The verification response confirms what officers are authorized to search for. A warrant for "financial records" does not authorize tearing apart walls looking for drugs. The subject now has real-time proof of scope to reference during the search.

**Verifying expiration:** Warrants have time limits. A warrant issued February 28 with a 14-day window cannot be executed on March 20. The subject can confirm this instantly.

**Verifying the warrant exists at all:** The most fundamental check. Criminals impersonating police, corrupt officers conducting unauthorized searches, and state actors fabricating warrants to intimidate targets — all produce documents that return 404.

## Third-Party Use

**Defense Attorneys**

**Suppression motions:** The cornerstone of Fourth Amendment litigation. If the warrant was invalid, expired, or exceeded in scope, all evidence obtained is potentially excludable (the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine). Defense attorneys verify the warrant's status at the time of execution — not just today, but historically. Was it ACTIVE on March 3 when the search occurred? Or had it already EXPIRED?

**Judges**

**Warrant return review:** Judges review returns to ensure law enforcement seized only what was authorized. A verified warrant + verified return creates an auditable chain the judge can trust.

**Prosecutors**

**Chain of custody:** From warrant issuance through seizure to evidence presentation, prosecutors need every link verified. A break anywhere — forged warrant, tampered return, mismatched inventory — undermines the entire case.

**Landlords and Property Managers**

**Access authorization:** When officers arrive at a multi-unit building demanding access to a tenant's apartment, the landlord can verify the warrant before providing keys. This protects both the tenant's rights and the landlord's liability.

**Cloud and Technology Companies**

**Electronic warrant verification:** When law enforcement serves an electronic search warrant demanding user data (emails, cloud storage, account records), tech companies currently rely on legal departments manually calling courts to verify authenticity. This process takes hours to days. A verify line lets the legal team confirm authenticity in seconds — critical when warrants demand immediate preservation of data that might be deleted.

**Banks and Financial Institutions**

**Seizure warrant verification:** Before freezing accounts or turning over financial records under a seizure warrant, banks can instantly verify the warrant is genuine and that the scope covers the specific accounts named.

**Media Organizations**

**Press freedom cases:** When reporting on warrants served against journalists, newsrooms, or whistleblowers, media organizations can verify the warrants are real and accurately described. This is essential for public interest reporting on government overreach.

## Verification Architecture

**The Search Warrant Fraud Problem**

- **Forged warrants for illegal searches** — Criminals impersonating police to gain entry to homes, or corrupt officers conducting unauthorized searches without judicial approval. The victim complies because the paper looks official.
- **Scope inflation** — A warrant authorizes search of the garage; officers search the entire house. The subject has no way to check the actual scope in real time. With a verify line, they can.
- **Expired warrants executed late** — A warrant had a 10-day execution window; officers show up on day 14. Currently, the subject wouldn't know. The verification response shows EXPIRED.
- **Fabricated warrants for intimidation** — State actors creating fake warrants to coerce dissidents, journalists, or political opponents. Recent reporting has documented authoritarian regimes fabricating legal documents — including warrants and court orders — as weapons against targets abroad. A verify line against an independent court domain exposes these instantly.
- **Warrant return tampering** — Altering the inventory of seized items after the fact to add evidence that wasn't actually found, or to omit items that were taken but shouldn't have been.
- **Judge shopping and forged signatures** — Presenting a warrant bearing a real judge's name who never signed it. The verification response confirms the actual issuing judge.

**The "Fake Warrant at the Door" Problem**

This is the uniquely time-sensitive verification scenario. Unlike a diploma or insurance certificate, where verification can wait days, a person confronted with a search warrant has **seconds** to decide whether to comply.

**Currently:** Comply or face obstruction charges. Challenge later, after the damage is done.

**With Live Verify:** Scan the verify line. Confirm it's real. Confirm the scope. Confirm it hasn't expired. *Then* comply — all in five seconds. If it returns 404, call 911 and do not open the door.

This transforms the power dynamic at the most coercive moment in civilian-government interaction. The subject is no longer required to take a stranger's word that a piece of paper is real.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

- **Federal Courts** — U.S. District Courts, Magistrate Judges (warrants.uscourts.gov)
- **State Courts** — Superior Courts, Circuit Courts, Municipal Courts (warrants.[state].gov)
- **Specialized Courts** — FISA Court (sealed warrants with SEALED status), military courts
- **International equivalents** — UK Magistrates' Courts, Canadian Provincial Courts, EU member state courts issuing European Investigation Orders

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

UK courts issue search warrants and authorizations under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

```
✓ courts.gov.uk/warrants/verify — UK courts search warrants and investigative authorizations
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Privacy Salt

**Critical for this use case.** Sealed warrants are common in drug investigations, terrorism cases, child exploitation cases, and organized crime. The hash must not leak the existence of sealed warrants through enumeration attacks.

If an adversary can iterate through possible warrant numbers and discover which ones return SEALED vs. 404, they learn which investigations exist — even without seeing the warrant's contents. This is a serious operational security risk.

The issuer-generated random salt line (printed on the warrant but not derivable from public information) prevents this. Without the salt, no amount of guessing case numbers will produce a valid hash. The warrant's existence is only confirmable by someone who possesses the physical or digital document.

| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Minutes to hours. Impossible after-hours, weekends, holidays. | **Instant.** | **Fast** — but only for law enforcement. |
| **Accessibility** | **Open.** Anyone with the warrant can verify. | **Limited.** Requires knowing which court to call, reaching the right clerk. | **Open.** | **Closed.** Law enforcement and court personnel only. Not available to the public or the search subject. |
| **After-Hours** | **24/7.** Hash lookup is always available. | **No.** Courts close at 5 PM. Warrants are often served at 6 AM. | **N/A.** | **24/7** for officers only. |
| **Scope Verification** | **Yes.** Response confirms authorized scope. | **Maybe.** Clerk may read scope over the phone. | **Trusting the paper.** Subject can't verify alterations. | **Yes** — for officers. |
| **Subject Access** | **Yes.** The person being searched can verify. | **Theoretically.** In practice, not while officers are at the door. | **No verification possible.** | **No.** Subject has no access. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-bound.** Court's own domain. | **Voice on a phone.** | **The paper.** | **System-bound.** Internal law enforcement network. |

**Why this remains strong:** Electronic warrant systems exist, but they are designed for law enforcement rather than the subject, landlord, or third-party recipient. That makes warrants one of the clearer cases where document-side verification is not replacing the native system; it is exposing a narrow civilian verification surface that the native system does not provide.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## International Landscape

Warrant requirements exist in most democracies, making this use case globally applicable:

- **United Kingdom:** Magistrates issue warrants under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). Officers must present the warrant to the occupier.
- **European Union:** The European Investigation Order (EIO) enables cross-border evidence gathering between member states — a warrant-like instrument that crosses jurisdictions and is even harder for subjects to verify.
- **Canada:** Criminal Code s.487 requires judicial authorization for searches. The Information to Obtain (ITO) is sworn before a justice.
- **Australia:** Search warrants issued under the Crimes Act 1914 (federal) and state equivalents.

In authoritarian regimes, warrants are often dispensed with entirely — or fabricated as a veneer of legality. In either case, the document's verifiability (or absence) becomes a civil liberties marker: a genuine warrant from an independent court, verifiable against that court's domain, is evidence that due process occurred. A 404 is evidence that it didn't.
