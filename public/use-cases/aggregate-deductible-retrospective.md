## Data Verified

Insured name, policy number, adjustment period (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.), incurred loss amount, total retrospective premium, amount due/returned, aggregate limit status.

**Document Types:**
- **Retrospective Premium Adjustment:** The bill/refund calculation.
- **Loss Run Report:** Detailed list of claims supporting the calculation.
- **Collateral Adjustment Notice:** Demand for Letter of Credit increase.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Insurance Carrier) and the document validity.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Document matches the carrier's system of record.
- **Void** — Adjustment was recalculated (common in retro plans).
- **Disputed** — The insured has formally contested this calculation.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insured** (second party) receives the premium adjustment statement from the insurance carrier (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The insured has their own verified copy of the retrospective premium calculation. Most of the time, the document sits in their risk management files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The insured can confirm at any time that the calculation matches what the carrier's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about premium amounts, or if they need to prove collateral requirements to a bank, the insured has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the carrier.

## Third-Party Use

The insured (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**New Insurers (Underwriters)**
When a company switches insurers, the new underwriter demands "Loss Runs" (5-year history). Companies often manipulate these PDF reports to hide bad claims and get cheaper rates. Verified documents prevent this fraud.

**Reinsurers**
Reinsurers need to verify that the primary carrier is calculating retro premiums correctly according to the treaty terms.

**M&A Due Diligence**
In a corporate acquisition, the buyer needs to know if the target company has a "ticking time bomb" of retrospective premium adjustments waiting to be billed. Verified adjustment statements reveal the true liability.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Clean Loss Run" Fraud Problem**

- **Photoshop:** Editing the "Incurred Losses" column in a PDF loss run to make a bad year look good.
- **Omission:** Deleting pages of large claims from the report.
- **Fake Paid status:** Forging a document saying "All retro premiums paid" to avoid disclosing a liability during M&A.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Commercial Carriers (Chubb, Travelers, Zurich, AIG, etc.)
- Third Party Administrators (TPAs) (Sedgwick, Gallagher Bassett) who handle claims and issue loss runs

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Retrospective premium adjustments contain enumerable values—round dollar amounts for standard premiums, predictable loss conversion factors (1.10, 1.15), and common policy periods. A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a company's risk profile and undercut their renewal pricing. Salt protects these competitive insurance positions.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Zurich issues retrospective premium adjustments for UK commercial insurance policies.

```
✓ retro.zurich.co.uk/verify — Issues retrospective premium adjustments for commercial insurance
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy numbers, adjustment periods, premium amounts, loss figures) — never insured company names or specific claim details — providing non-repudiation of the premium adjustment.

**Jurisdictional Requirements (Insurance/Reinsurance)**

Retrospective premium calculations in international reinsurance require:
- **Geographic separation:** Witness firms not in the primary carrier's jurisdiction
- **Lloyd's compliance:** High-value policies ($50M+) expect independent verification from London Market witnesses
- **Bermuda Captive Insurance:** Non-US witness firms required for policies involving US insureds to satisfy double-trigger documentation rules

**Cross-border reinsurance:** EU Solvency II requires witness firms for cross-border policy documents.

## Competition vs. Broker Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | Broker Portal (Marsh/Aon) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cross-Carrier** | **Universal.** Works for any carrier document. | **Siloed.** Portals usually only show data for *current* placements. Hard to get historical data from 5 years ago/different broker. |
| **M&A Access** | **Easy.** Seller sends verified PDFs to Data Room. Buyer verifies. | **Hard.** Buyer cannot access Seller's private broker portal without complex permissioning. |
| **Immutability** | **High.** Hash proves the document hasn't changed. | **Medium.** Portal data changes dynamically; hard to prove "what was the loss number on Dec 31?" |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** M&A transactions and underwriting submissions rely on **static documents** (snapshots in time) exchanged between parties who don't share system access. "Here is our loss run as of Jan 1." Live Verify makes that static snapshot trustworthy without requiring the recipient to log in to the sender's insurance portal.
