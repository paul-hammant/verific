## What is a UBO Declaration?

Criminals and sanctioned oligarchs often hide behind "Shell Companies." They might own 10 different companies that own each other, making it impossible to see who is really in control.

The **Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO)** Declaration is the document where a company must "unmask" its true human owners to the government (like FinCEN in the US).

Verifying these declarations ensures that a company opening a bank account isn't lying about who owns it, which is the primary way the world stops money laundering and terrorism financing.

## Data Verified

Reporting company name, Tax ID (EIN), Beneficial Owner names, ownership percentages, control relationships, identifying document numbers (redacted), date of filing.

**Document Types:**
- **BOI Report Extract:** Beneficial Ownership Information (under CTA).
- **UBO Self-Certification:** For bank onboarding.
- **Complex Ownership Diagram:** Visual chart of parent/subsidiary links.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`fincen.gov`, `registry.gov.uk`) and current filing status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Filing matches the latest registry record.
- **Outdated** — Ownership has changed; new filing required.
- **In-Dispute** — Control contest reported.
- **Flagged** — Associated with a sanctioned entity or person.

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Owner** benefits from verification.

**Bank Onboarding:** Proving to a bank during KYC (Know Your Customer) that the ownership structure they are presenting is the *exact same one* filed with the government. This prevents the "2-week delay" while the bank manually verifies ownership.

**Contract Bidding:** Proving transparency to a government contractor or a major corporation that the company isn't a front for a sanctioned individual.

## Third-Party Use

**Bank Compliance Officers (AML)**
**Instant KYC:** Verification allows the bank to instantly trust the paper/PDF "Declaration of Ownership" provided by the customer, as it links directly to the FinCEN or Companies House domain record.

**Supply Chain Auditors**
**Anti-Corruption:** Ensuring that "Tier 2" suppliers aren't secretly owned by the same executives as "Tier 1" suppliers (collusion detection).

**Investigative Journalists**
**Corruption Tracking:** Verifying the "Official" ownership claims of shell companies involved in public projects.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Shell Game" Fraud Problem**

- **Layering:** Creating 10 levels of shell companies to hide that a sanctioned oligarch actually owns the business.
- **Front-Men:** Listing a secretary or lawyer as the "Owner" on the paper declaration while the real owner remains hidden in the background.
- **Fabricated Filings:** Showing a fake "FinCEN Receipt" to a bank to hide that the company never actually filed its ownership report.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Registries:** (e.g., U.K. Companies House, Singapore ACRA).
**Federal Agencies:** (e.g., U.S. FinCEN).
**Private Compliance Platforms:** (e.g., Dun & Bradstreet, Moody's).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Declarations contain sensitive PII. The hash must be salted to prevent "guessing" names of owners.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Companies House maintains the registry of beneficial ownership declarations filed under UK company law.

```
✓ psc.companieshouse.gov.uk — Records beneficial ownership declarations
  ✓ companieshouse.gov.uk — Registers UK companies
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Equivalents

| | UK | US | EU |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Authority** | Companies House | FinCEN | Member state UBO registries |
| **Document** | PSC (People with Significant Control) register entry | BOI (Beneficial Ownership Information) report | UBO register entry (varies by member state) |
| **Legal basis** | Companies Act 2006, Part 21A | Corporate Transparency Act 2021 | 4th/5th Anti-Money Laundering Directives (4MLD/5MLD) |
| **Potential verify: domain** | `psc.companieshouse.gov.uk/v` | `fincen.gov/boi/v` | `ubo-register.kvk.nl/v` (varies by state) |
| **Key difference** | Public register — PSC data freely searchable online | Federal register — access restricted to authorised users (law enforcement, financial institutions) | Each member state maintains its own national register; public access rules vary (some restricted after CJEU ruling C-37/20) |

**Further Jurisdictional Peers**

- **Australia:** ASIC company register; no separate UBO register yet but reforms underway
- **Canada:** Federal beneficial ownership register (2024) + provincial corporate registries
- **Singapore:** ACRA (Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) Register of Registrable Controllers
- **Japan:** National Tax Agency; company register at Legal Affairs Bureau
- **Switzerland:** Not public but companies must maintain UBO records under AMLA
- **Hong Kong:** Companies Registry significant controllers register under Companies (Amendment) Ord 2018
- **Netherlands:** UBO register at KVK (Chamber of Commerce) under Wwft

**Bribery & Corruption**

Shell companies are the primary vehicle for hiding bribery payments and corrupt proceeds — UBO transparency is an anti-corruption tool as much as an AML tool.

- **UK:** PSC (People with Significant Control) register public since 2016; Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 strengthened Companies House verification powers, driven partly by anti-corruption advocacy following the "Laundromat" and "Pandora Papers" revelations
- **US:** Corporate Transparency Act 2021 (FinCEN BOI reporting) — championed by anti-corruption groups including the FACT Coalition; aims to end anonymous shell company formation that has facilitated foreign bribery and kleptocratic wealth hiding
- **OECD/FATF:** Beneficial ownership transparency is a key FATF and OECD anti-corruption recommendation; the FATF's 2023 amendments to Recommendation 24 strengthened BO requirements specifically citing corruption risks
- **France:** RBE (Registre des Bénéficiaires Effectifs) — public since 2017 under Sapin II; France explicitly links UBO transparency to its anti-corruption framework
- **Ukraine/emerging economies:** BO transparency is seen as a critical anti-corruption reform — Ukraine's public BO register was a condition of EU integration and a key demand of anti-corruption civil society
- **Transparency International:** Publishes annual assessments of BO transparency by country; advocates for public registers as essential anti-corruption infrastructure; their research links jurisdictions with weak BO transparency to higher corruption risk

**Tax Evasion & Transparency**

UBO registers serve tax transparency as much as AML. Tax evasion uses distinct legal frameworks from anti-money laundering:

- **FATCA (US):** Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 2010 — requires foreign financial institutions to report US person accounts; UBO declarations feed FATCA reporting
- **CRS (OECD):** Common Reporting Standard — 100+ jurisdictions automatically exchange financial account information; UBO data is a key CRS input
- **UK:** Criminal Finances Act 2017 — corporate offence of failure to prevent tax evasion; Companies House reforms strengthen UBO verification for tax purposes
- **EU:** DAC6 (Directive on Administrative Cooperation) — mandatory disclosure of cross-border tax arrangements; UBO data supports DAC6 analysis
- **Panama Papers / Pandora Papers:** These leaks demonstrated how opaque beneficial ownership enabled tax evasion at scale — driving CTA (US), PSC reforms (UK), and EU-wide UBO registers
- **OECD BEPS:** Base Erosion and Profit Shifting framework — Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) complements UBO transparency

**Cybercrime-Enabled Financial Crime**

Shell companies with opaque beneficial ownership are used to register domains for phishing, set up fake merchant accounts for payment fraud, and launder ransomware proceeds.

- **UK:** Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 — Companies House identity verification aims to prevent fake company registrations used in cyber fraud
- **US:** FinCEN BOI reporting helps law enforcement trace corporate vehicles used in BEC (Business Email Compromise) and investment fraud schemes
- **Crypto:** Opaque corporate structures are used to operate unregistered crypto exchanges and DeFi platforms; UBO transparency is a key regulatory tool

**Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML)**

Shell companies with opaque ownership are the primary vehicle for TBML invoicing fraud — creating fake trading relationships for over/under-invoicing schemes. UBO transparency disrupts TBML by revealing that "buyer" and "seller" are controlled by the same person.

- **TBML nexus:** Over/under-invoicing, phantom shipments, and multiple invoicing require shell companies on both sides of a trade; beneficial ownership registers that expose common control between counterparties are the most effective TBML prevention tool
- **Free Trade Zones (FTZs):** Companies registered in FTZs (Dubai JAFZA, Singapore FTZ, Hong Kong) are disproportionately used in TBML — UBO requirements in these zones are often weaker than in the wider economy, creating a gap that TBML operators exploit
- **FATF:** Recommendation 24 (beneficial ownership) specifically references trade-based laundering as a risk that UBO transparency mitigates; the 2023 amendments strengthened BO requirements with TBML explicitly in scope

**Unexplained Wealth & Asset Recovery**

Opaque beneficial ownership is the primary obstacle to asset recovery — kleptocrats and criminals hide assets behind layers of shell companies. UBO registers are the foundation of effective confiscation regimes.

- **Asset recovery nexus:** Opaque beneficial ownership is the primary obstacle to asset recovery — kleptocrats and criminals hide assets behind layers of shell companies; UBO registers are the foundation of effective confiscation
- **UK:** UWOs require identification of the true owner of property — PSC register and Companies House verification are essential tools; Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 strengthened identity verification to support asset tracing
- **US:** DOJ Kleptocracy Initiative relies on UBO information to trace assets; FinCEN BOI database will be available to law enforcement for asset recovery investigations
- **France:** AGRASC coordinates with RBE (beneficial ownership register) to trace confiscable assets
- **Switzerland:** Swiss authorities have frozen/returned billions in kleptocratic assets (Marcos, Abacha, Duvalier, Uzbekistan cases); UBO due diligence under AMLA is critical to these efforts
- **Italy:** Anti-mafia confiscation regime traces assets through complex corporate structures; Antimafia Investigation Directorate (DIA) uses corporate registry data
- **FATF:** Recommendation 4 (confiscation and provisional measures) explicitly links UBO transparency to effective asset recovery

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the filing authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the declaration.
## Competition vs. Registry Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | Public Registry Portal | Private KYC Utility (Swift) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Only the specific company is verified. | **Low.** Many registries are public/searchable (privacy risk). | **Very Low.** Centralized data pool. |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the Gov domain. | **Medium.** Prone to UI spoofing/phishing. | **High.** But requires expensive membership. |
| **Immediacy** | **Instant.** Scan the document during onboarding. | **Slow.** Login, search, pay fee, download PDF. | **Fast.** But siloed. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** It bridges the gap between the **Private Corporate File** and the **Public Government Record**. It allows a company to prove its status to a partner *without* the partner needing to independently navigate a foreign, complex, and potentially expensive government registry website.
