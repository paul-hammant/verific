## What are Royalty Statements?

In the media and publishing world, an author's or artist's income is typically a percentage of sales, tracked in a **Royalty Statement**. These documents arrive semi-annually and detail how many books, songs, or licenses were sold and at what price.

Because these statements determine the distribution of millions of dollars, they are a primary source of "Creative Accounting" and outright fraud. A publisher might "edit" a statement to show 10,000 sales instead of 100,000 to avoid paying the creator. Similarly, an author might "alter" a past statement to prove a higher historical income when negotiating a new "Advance" with a different publisher. Verified hashes bind the **Sales Quantities, Unit Prices, and Total Payout** to the publisher's domain (e.g., `penguinrandomhouse.com` or `universalmusic.com`).

## Data Verified

Author/Artist name, publisher name, project title (ISBN/ISRC), royalty period, itemized sales units (by format), royalty rates (percentages), gross earnings, net payout, statement ID, issue date.

**Document Types:**
- **Royalty Statement:** The periodic financial report.
- **Publishing Contract (Long-Form):** The primary legal agreement.
- **Deal Memo / Term Sheet:** The summary of an upcoming "Advance."
- **Subsidiary Rights Notice:** Proof of sale for film/foreign rights.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`prh.com`, `sony.com`, `spotify.com`) and the payment standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Paid / Cleared** — Funds have been disbursed to the author/agent.
- **Accrued** — Earnings verified but held (e.g., against an unearned advance).
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** A corrected statement exists; this version is void.
- **In Dispute** — **ALERT:** An audit or legal challenge is active for this period.

## Second-Party Use

The **Author / Artist / Creator** benefits from verification.

**Mortgage / Loan Applications:** Many authors have volatile incomes. Providing verified "Royalty Statements" to a bank allows the lender to trust the income data without requiring 3 years of complex tax returns, potentially securing a mortgage for a "Freelancer" faster.

**Agent Audits:** An author can scan their own statement to ensure that the version they received from their "Agency" matches what the "Publisher" actually sent, preventing unscrupulous agents from "skimming" off the top.

## Third-Party Use

**Literary / Talent Agents**
**Negotiation Power:** Before moving an author to a new publisher, the agent provides verified statements of past performance. "Verified by Random House" ensures the new publisher that the sales figures aren't inflated, leading to higher advances.

**Tax Authorities (IRS / HMRC)**
**Income Audit:** Verifying that the "Royalty Income" reported on a tax return matches the verified payouts from the publisher, reducing the need for manual paperwork requests.

**Divorce & Estate Lawyers**
**Asset Valuation:** Intellectual property is a lifelong asset. Verified hashes allow for the accurate valuation of a "Backlist" during asset division or probate.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Sales" Fraud Problem**

- **Sales Under-Reporting:** Publishers hiding sales from authors to keep royalty payments low.
- **Advance Inflation:** Creating a fake "Past Deal Memo" to trick a new publisher into paying a larger advance.
- **Contract Edit:** Tampering with a PDF contract to change a 10% royalty rate into 15% before a dispute.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Publishing Houses.**
**Music Labels / Streaming Platforms.**
**Literary Agencies (Sub-issuers).**

**Privacy Salt:** High. Royalty earnings and specific sales volumes are highly sensitive private financial data. The hash must be salted to prevent competitors from mapping a rival's entire bestseller list.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues publishing contracts and royalty statements

```
✓ royalties.penguinrandomhouse.co.uk/verify — Issues publishing contracts and royalty statements
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Royalty accounting is famously opaque. By turning statements into verifiable digital bridges, we create a transparent "Chain of Value" that ensures creators are paid exactly what they are owed according to the agreed-upon contract.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the publisher's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (statement ID, report period, author name, sales quantities, royalty rate, payment amount, issue date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the royalty statement.
