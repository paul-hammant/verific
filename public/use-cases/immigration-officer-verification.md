**Perspective:** This use case is written from the resident's or traveller's perspective. The enforcement visit is initiated by the immigration officer.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The officer can detain, arrest, or initiate deportation proceedings — consequences that cannot be safely ignored or resisted at the door.

**Verification asymmetry:** The person contacted is being asked to cooperate immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the officer's identity, agency, and current enforcement authority.

**Why would you bother checking?** Because the power asymmetry is extreme and the consequences of complying with a fake officer are irreversible. A person who follows instructions from a fraudulent "immigration agent" may be illegally detained, coerced into paying cash "fines," have identity documents confiscated, or — in the worst cases documented by law enforcement — be trafficked. Verification doesn't obstruct a legitimate officer; it protects the resident from criminals exploiting the fear of state authority to extract compliance.

## Data Verified

Officer name, photo (hash), badge number, agency (ICE, CBP), unit (ERO, HSI), employment status (Active/Retired), jurisdiction, date of credential issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Standard Duty Badge:** For uniformed officers.
- **Credential Card:** For plainclothes special agents.
- **Notice of Entry:** (Form I-200 equivalent) linked to the officer's ID.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ice.gov`, `cbp.gov`) and current employee status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active On-Duty** — Officer is authorized to perform enforcement actions.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Access revoked; officer not authorized for field work.
- **Retired** — No longer has enforcement authority.
- **Invalid** — Badge reported lost or serial mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Immigration Officer** benefits from verification.

**De-escalation:** Proving their identity to a fearful family or a defensive employer during a field encounter. Verification reduces the chance of physical conflict or "Impostor Panic" when plainclothes agents arrive at a location.

**Building Access:** Proving their verified identity to local police or facility managers when accessing high-security private properties for authorized enforcement.

## Third-Party Use

**Immigrant Communities (Vulnerable Residents)**
**Extortion Prevention:** Before opening the door to people claiming to be "ICE Agents," a resident can ask to see the badge through a peephole. Scanning the hash confirms the person is a "Verified On-Duty" agent, preventing the common "Extortion Scam" where criminals pose as agents to demand cash "fines" to avoid deportation.

**Employers (Workplace Audits)**
**Vetting:** Verifying the credentials of individuals arriving for an I-9 audit or workplace inspection to ensure they aren't corporate spies or scammers.

**Local Law Enforcement**
**Inter-agency Coordination:** Patrol officers can instantly verify the credentials of "Plainclothes Agents" they encounter in the field, preventing "Blue-on-Blue" friendly fire incidents.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Enforcement Impersonation" Fraud Problem**

- **Extortion Scams:** Criminals buying realistic uniforms and fake "DHS" badges to target vulnerable immigrants for cash payments.
- **Credential Hiding:** A terminated officer keeping their physical badge to continue exercising "Police Powers" illegally.
- **Phishing Badges:** Creating fake ID cards with QR codes that link to a fraudulent "DHS-verify.com" website controlled by scammers.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Department of Homeland Security (DHS).**
**Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE).**
**Customs & Border Protection (CBP).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Officer names and photos are high-value targets for harassment. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Doxxing" attacks where people try to map all agent identities.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Credentials immigration enforcement officers for federal authority.

```
✓ ice.gov/officer/verify — Credentials immigration enforcement officers for federal authority
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the immigration service's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (officer names, badge numbers, agency affiliations, assignment dates) — never sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of immigration officer status.

## Competition vs. Calling the Field Office

| Feature | Live Verify | Calling the Field Office | Visual Inspection (Logo) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `dhs.gov`. | **Human.** Relies on a dispatcher answering honestly. | **Zero.** Uniforms are easily faked. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to status. | **Vague.** "Yes, we have an Agent Miller." | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often takes 10-20 minutes to reach duty officer. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if suspended *today*. | **N/A.** Dispatchers may not see HR records. | **N/A.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Threshold Moment." Decisions about admitting officers happen at the door under extreme stress. Residents don't want to engage in a long conversation or a phone call while an "Official" is pounding on the door. Live Verify turn the **ID Badge** into a live, non-confrontational safety tool that provides instant, high-authority trust.
