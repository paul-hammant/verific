## What is Candidate Work-Sample Provenance?

A candidate submits a take-home assignment, a code sample, a portfolio piece, or a written
exercise as part of a hiring process. The employer has to decide two separate things about it:

1. **Is this artifact genuinely what it claims to be** — produced by this candidate, at the stated
   time, under the stated conditions, and unaltered since?
2. **Is it any good** — does it demonstrate the skill the role needs?

Live Verify addresses only the **first** question. The second is, and remains, human judgement.

This distinction matters more than it used to. As the [Huntress "AI arms race in
recruiting"](https://www.huntress.com/blog) framing describes, candidate-side tooling can generate
flawless, technically-correct submissions for screening tests and take-home assignments in seconds.
An employer reviewing a polished artifact has no way to tell *when* it was produced, *whether it was
edited after submission*, or *whether the person who submitted it is the person who will do the job*.

A **work-sample provenance claim** is a short, stable statement — bound by a `verify:` line to a
domain that can actually stand behind it — that pins the artifact to a moment, an identity reference,
and a set of conditions. It does not, and cannot, prove the artifact was produced without AI
assistance. Stating that limit loudly is the whole point of the design.

## What gets attested

The verifiable text is a short header the candidate (or the platform) attaches to the submission.
The inline styling is ignored by clip mode — only the text content is hashed.

<div style="max-width: 560px; margin: 24px auto; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; background: #f9f9f9; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #999; font-size: 1em; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;">

</div>

**Privacy note:** the candidate's name is not in the verifiable text — only a reference. The employer
matches the reference to the person through separate identity checks (the same privacy pattern used by
[Exam and Test Results Verification](view.html?doc=exam-test-results-verification) and
[Right to Work Verification](view.html?doc=right-to-work-verification)).

**The `Conditions` line is load-bearing and must be honest.** "Unproctored, 4h window" tells the
employer exactly what was and was not controlled. A provenance claim that implied "no AI used" when the
assignment was unproctored would be a lie the hash would faithfully preserve. See the honest-limit
section below.

## Data Verified

- **Issuer** — who operates the endpoint and stands behind the seal (an assessment platform, a
  bootcamp, a prior employer, or the candidate's own domain for self-attested portfolio work)
- **Candidate reference** — a pseudonymous handle, resolved to a person out-of-band
- **Assignment identifier and version** — which exercise, which revision
- **Submission timestamp** — when the artifact was sealed
- **Conditions** — proctored / unproctored, time window, tools permitted or forbidden
- **Status** — see below

The artifact *itself* is not in the verifiable text. For a large submission (a repository, a document),
the seal covers this short header; the header should name the artifact's own content hash if
tamper-evidence over the whole artifact is required, exactly as
[Page-at-a-time hashing](../docs/page-at-a-time-hashing.md) binds a document body to a short claim.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain and the responder status. No claim content is echoed — the employer already
holds the submission.

**Status Indications:**
- **Submission Sealed** — the artifact was received and pinned at the stated time, unaltered since
- **Superseded** — the candidate submitted a later revision (points to the newer reference)
- **Withdrawn** — the candidate or issuer withdrew the submission
- **Under Review** — an integrity flag is open (e.g. plagiarism/collusion query); the seal stands but
  the issuer signals caution

## Second-Party Use

The candidate is the second party and benefits directly:

- **Fix authorship of honest work:** a candidate who *did* produce the sample under real conditions can
  prove the timestamp and that nothing was changed afterwards — protecting them if a competing
  submission is later found to be a copy of theirs.
- **Carry it between processes:** a sealed portfolio piece bound to the candidate's own domain travels
  across multiple applications without re-attestation, the same way
  [Self-Attested Authorship](view.html?doc=self-attested-authorship-copyright) travels with a creative work.
- **Rebut a false accusation:** if an employer suspects post-submission editing, the seal settles the
  factual question of *when* and *whether-altered* — leaving only the judgement question.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers / hiring managers**
- **Confirm a submission is unaltered:** the artifact under review is the one sealed at submission time,
  not a version quietly improved afterwards.
- **Confirm the conditions:** read the `Conditions` line to weight the sample appropriately —
  an unproctored take-home is evidence of *a* capability, not *the candidate's unaided* capability.

**Staffing agencies / assessment platforms**
- **Pass a sealed result to the end client:** the client sees the platform's own domain stand behind
  the submission, rather than a forwarded PDF the agency could have edited. Complements
  [Recruitment Agency Verification](view.html?doc=recruitment-agency-verification).

**Bootcamps / prior employers**
- **Attest a real project:** a training provider or previous employer confirms a portfolio piece was
  genuinely produced in their programme, closing the "invented portfolio" gap the Huntress article
  describes (a stolen LinkedIn profile used to manufacture a plausible history).

## Verification Architecture

**The work-sample fraud problem**

- **Post-submission editing** — the candidate submits, then keeps improving, then presents the improved
  version as the original timed submission. The seal's timestamp defeats this.
- **Substitution** — a different, better artifact is swapped in for the one actually submitted. The hash
  fails on any change.
- **Invented portfolio** — work attributed to a candidate that they did not produce. A self-attested
  claim bound to a *controllable authoritative* domain (a bootcamp, a prior employer) is checkable;
  a bare PDF is not.
- **Ghost-writing / collusion** — someone other than the candidate produced the work. Provenance
  **cannot** catch this on its own; it can only record the declared conditions and surface an
  `Under Review` integrity flag when the issuer has independent reason to doubt.

**Who issues these**

- **Assessment platforms** (coding-test and take-home vendors) — endpoint on the platform's domain.
- **Bootcamps / universities** — for portfolio and capstone work.
- **Prior employers** — for real project work a candidate may reference.
- **The candidate's own domain** — for genuinely self-attested portfolio pieces, with the honest-limit
  caveat that a self-issued seal proves *timestamp and integrity*, not independent authorship.

**Pre-hire assessment scores are a neighbouring case, not this one.** A formal screening-test *score*
issued by a testing body — HackerRank, a proctored exam vendor, College Board, a professional board —
is already covered by [Exam and Test Results Verification](view.html?doc=exam-test-results-verification),
which handles score-inflation fraud and privacy-by-reference. This page covers the *work artifact*
(the code, the document, the portfolio piece), not the graded score. When a process produces both, use
the exam page for the score and this page for the sample.

## The honest limit: provenance is not proof-of-humanity

This is the single most important section. Live Verify seals **what** was submitted, **when**, and
**that it is unaltered** — attributed to a reference under **declared conditions**. It does **not** and
**cannot** establish that:

- no LLM or AI tool was used to produce the artifact, or
- the person named by the reference is the person who actually did the work.

Those are exactly the questions the Huntress article says employers now need answered — and they are
**out of scope** for a hash-lookup protocol, in the same way content-level bot detection is out of
scope for [ad-placement provenance](view.html?doc=ad-placement-provenance) and liveness is out of
scope for a document check. Detecting AI-generated content, or proving a live human authored something,
is a statistical / behavioural / in-session problem, not a hash problem.

What provenance *does* do is remove the ambiguity around timing and tampering so that the human
reviewer can spend their judgement on the questions that actually require it. If an employer needs
assurance that a *live human* produced work in the moment, that is a proctoring / liveness concern —
see [Identity-Verification-Completed Attestation](view.html?doc=idv-completed-attestation) for the
adjacent, honestly-scoped piece, and note that neither claims to *detect deepfakes*.
