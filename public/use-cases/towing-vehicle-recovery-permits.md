## What are Towing Permits?

In the urban environment, **Towing Permits** are the "Authorization to Seize" private property. From the **Tow Truck Operator Badge** to the **Municipal Rotation Card**, these documents prove that a driver is legally licensed, insured, and background-checked to tow vehicles on behalf of the city or a private property owner.

This industry is a primary target for "Bandit Towers"—unlicensed operators who roam streets to illegally tow cars and then demand hundreds of dollars in "Cash-Only" recovery fees. Fraud is high-stakes: criminals often use fake city badges to trick drivers into thinking their car was legally "impounded" for a violation. Live Verify allows a vehicle owner or police officer to scan the operator's ID or the truck's permit to verify: **"Is this company currently authorized to tow in this city, and are they on the official police rotation list?"**

## Data Verified

License number, operator name, company name, truck unit number, vehicle license plate (linked), photograph (via hash), expiration date, background check status, insurance policy ID, police rotation zone assignment, authorized fee schedule ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Tow Truck Operator ID:** Worn by the driver.
- **Vehicle Storage Receipt:** (Linked hash) the "Key" to get your car back.
- **Impound Authorization:** (Linked hash) signed by a police officer or landlord.
- **Annual Safety Inspection:** Decal on the truck window.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`springfieldpd.gov`, `dmv.state.gov`, `city.gov`) and the operator's standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Authorized** — Operator is currently licensed and on the city rotation.
- **Suspended** — **CRITICAL:** Authority is revoked (e.g., due to predatory pricing or illegal towing).
- **Insurance Lapsed** — **CRITICAL:** The truck is not currently insured; towing is illegal.
- **Wrong Zone** — **ALERT:** Operator is authorized, but assigned to a DIFFERENT part of the city.

## Second-Party Use

The **Vehicle Owner / Driver** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Theft Defense:** A driver walks out to find their car being hooked by a tow truck. The operator claims they are "on rotation" for the police. The driver scans the operator's badge. If it returns **"ACTIVE - ZONE 4,"** they know the tow is legitimate. If it returns **"UNKNOWN"** or **"SUSPENDED,"** they can call 911 to report a vehicle theft in progress.

**Fee Protection:** A driver at an impound lot is told the fee is $500. They scan the verified hash on their receipt. If the hash returns **"MAX LEGAL FEE: $250,"** they have the cryptographic proof needed to refuse the over-charge and report the operator to the city.

## Third-Party Use

**Police / Traffic Patrol**
**Rotation Audit:** During a busy shift, an officer can scan the badges of operators arriving at accident scenes. Verified hashes ensure that "Bandit Towers" aren't jumping the queue and stealing business from authorized, insured vendors.

**Property Managers / HOAs**
**Compliance Vetting:** Before hiring a towing company to clear a private lot, the manager scans the company's verified hash. This ensures the firm has the state-mandated "Predatory Towing" liability insurance, protecting the manager from being sued by angry tenants.

**Commercial Insurers**
**Risk Management:** Verifying that a fleet of 50 tow trucks is maintaining 100% verified, active operator permits to ensure the carrier's liability coverage remains valid.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Bandit Tower" Fraud Problem**

- **Badge Mimicry:** Printing realistic city "Rotation Permits" using a home printer to pose as a police-authorized vendor.
- **ID Duplication:** Using one valid card for a fleet of 10 generic, un-insured trucks.
- **Status Hiding:** Continuing to tow using a physical "Valid" card after the city revoked the license for violence or illegal charging.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Municipal Police Departments.**
**State Departments of Transportation (DOT).**
**City Revenue / Licensing Bureaus.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Driver names and truck locations are private employment data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Mass Fleet Scraping" by predatory competitors.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Towing operator permits are issued by local authorities that administer towing and vehicle recovery services.

```
✓ tfl.gov.uk/towing/verify — Issues towing operator permits and rotation authorizations
  ✓ localauthority.gov.uk — Administers local licensing and permits
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Towing is a "Coercive Service." By turning static cards into live digital bridges, we ensure that "Authority to Seize" is backed by the cryptographic truth of the city vault, protecting citizens from theft and the legitimate industry from bandit competition.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive municipalities' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (license number, operator name, company name, truck unit number, vehicle license plate, photograph hash, expiration date, background check status, insurance policy ID, police rotation zone assignment, authorized fee schedule ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the towing operator permit.
