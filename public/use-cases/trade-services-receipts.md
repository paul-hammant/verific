## What is a Trade Service Receipt?

When a plumber fixes your boiler or an electrician rewires your kitchen, you receive a receipt. But in the cash economy, these receipts are often handwritten, unverifiable, or simply don't exist—enabling tax evasion, warranty disputes, and consumer fraud.

A **Verified Trade Service Receipt** is pre-registered with tax authorities *before* the work begins. The customer receives a receipt tied to the tradesperson's tax registration, license number, and insurance policy. If the receipt can't be verified, the customer knows something is wrong.

## The Pre-Registration Model

The key innovation is **pre-registration**: before work begins, the tradesperson registers the job with the tax authority's system. This creates an expected receipt that the customer can verify after payment.

**How It Works:**

1. **Job Registration:** Tradesperson logs job details (customer address, estimated amount, work type) before starting
2. **Work Completion:** Upon completion, tradesperson finalizes the receipt with actual amounts
3. **Customer Verification:** Customer scans/verifies receipt against tax authority records
4. **Tax Reporting:** Receipt automatically feeds into tradesperson's tax filings

This creates **symmetric incentives**: the customer wants verification (for protections), and the tradesperson must register (to provide verifiable receipts).

## Data Verified

Tradesperson name/business, tax registration number (UTR, ABN, EIN), trade license number, insurance reference, customer address (hashed for privacy), service description, itemized costs, tax amounts, payment method, completion date.

**Document Types:**
- **Service Receipt:** Standard completion and payment record
- **Completion Certificate:** For regulated work (gas, electrical) requiring sign-off
- **Warranty Card:** Manufacturer warranty registration tied to installer
- **Quote/Estimate:** Pre-work pricing (verifiable to prevent bait-and-switch)

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`hmrc.gov.uk`, `ato.gov.au`, `irs.gov`) and registration status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Receipt matches pre-registered job, tax reported
- **Pending** — Job registered, receipt not yet finalized
- **Mismatch** — **ALERT:** Receipt amount doesn't match registration
- **Unregistered** — **CRITICAL:** No pre-registration exists for this job reference
- **Revoked** — Receipt cancelled (e.g., work failed inspection)

## Customer Incentives

Why would customers demand verified receipts?

**Warranty Protection:** "If you can't verify this receipt, the manufacturer warranty is void." Boiler manufacturers, appliance makers, and building material suppliers can require verified installation receipts for warranty claims.

**Insurance Claims:** Home insurers can require verified receipts for work done. If your house floods due to bad plumbing, the insurer checks: "Was this installed by a verified, licensed, insured tradesperson?"

**Tax Deductions:** Home office improvements, energy efficiency upgrades, and accessibility modifications may be tax-deductible—but only with verifiable receipts tied to registered contractors.

**Resale Value:** When selling a property, verified receipts for major work (new roof, rewiring, extension) provide documented proof for buyers and surveyors.

**Small Claims Evidence:** If the work fails and you sue in small claims court, a verified receipt proves: who did the work, when, what was paid, and that they were (or weren't) properly registered.

## Second-Party Use

The **Customer (Homeowner/Business)** benefits from verification.

**Dispute Resolution:** If the boiler breaks in month two, the verified receipt proves exactly what was installed, by whom, and what warranty applies.

**Expense Tracking:** For landlords, property managers, and businesses, verified receipts integrate directly into accounting systems with confidence in authenticity.

## Third-Party Use

**Tax Authorities (HMRC, ATO, IRS)**
**Compliance Enforcement:** Pre-registration creates a real-time audit trail. Cash payments can still be tracked because the job was registered before work began.

**Trade Licensing Boards**
**Consumer Protection:** Verification confirms the tradesperson holds current, valid licenses for the work performed.

**Insurers**
**Claims Processing:** Verify that work was done by insured, licensed professionals before paying property damage claims.

**Courts / Small Claims**
**Evidence:** Verified receipts provide authenticated evidence of the commercial relationship, work scope, and payment.

**Property Surveyors / Inspectors**
**Due Diligence:** When surveying a property for sale, verified receipts document the history of major works.

## Verification Architecture

**The Cash Economy Problem**

- **Tax Evasion:** Tradespeople offering "cash discount, no VAT" avoid tax obligations
- **Phantom Receipts:** Fake or inflated receipts for insurance fraud
- **License Fraud:** Unlicensed workers claiming credentials they don't hold
- **Warranty Dodging:** "That wasn't our work" disputes when things go wrong
- **Consumer Exploitation:** No paper trail for shoddy work

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Tax Authorities:** HMRC (UK), ATO (Australia), IRS/State FTBs (US), CRA (Canada)
**Trade Licensing Bodies:** Gas Safe, NICEIC, state contractor boards
**Industry Associations:** Federation of Master Builders, Master Plumbers associations
**SaaS Platforms:** Trade management software integrating with tax APIs

**Pre-Registration Flow**

```
Customer Request → Tradesperson Registers Job → Work Performed →
Receipt Issued → Customer Verifies → Tax Authority Records Updated
```

Each step is timestamped. If a tradesperson tries to skip registration, they can't issue a verifiable receipt—and increasingly, customers will refuse to pay without one.

**Privacy Considerations**

Customer addresses are hashed. The verification confirms "this receipt is valid" without exposing the customer's identity or location to third parties.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues trade services invoices

```
✓ receipt.example-plumber.co.uk/verify — Issues trade services invoices
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## International Variations

**United Kingdom:** HMRC integration via Making Tax Digital (MTD) APIs. Gas Safe and NICEIC for regulated trades.

**Australia:** ABN verification through ATO. State licensing for electrical, plumbing, building.

**United States:** State-level contractor licensing. IRS reporting via 1099-NEC for payments over $600.

**European Union:** VAT registration verification. Country-specific trade licensing.

**Canada:** GST/HST registration verification. Provincial trade licensing.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive tax authorities' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (tradesperson name/business, tax registration number, trade license number, insurance reference, customer address hashed, service description, itemized costs, tax amounts, payment method, completion date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the trade service receipt.


## Competition vs. Paper Receipts

| Feature | Verified Receipt | Handwritten Receipt | No Receipt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tax Compliance** | **Automatic.** Pre-registered with authority. | **Uncertain.** May never be reported. | **None.** |
| **License Proof** | **Linked.** License number verified. | **Claimed.** Could be fake or expired. | **N/A.** |
| **Warranty Support** | **Strong.** Manufacturer can verify installer. | **Weak.** "We didn't install this." | **None.** |
| **Court Evidence** | **Authenticated.** Cryptographic proof. | **Disputable.** "I didn't write that." | **N/A.** |
| **Insurance Claims** | **Streamlined.** Insurer verifies instantly. | **Manual.** Requires investigation. | **Denied.** |

## Adoption Path

**Phase 1 - Voluntary:** Early adopters (quality-focused tradespeople) use verified receipts as competitive differentiation. "We're fully registered and verified."

**Phase 2 - Incentivized:** Insurers offer premium discounts for homes with verified maintenance records. Manufacturers require verified installation for warranty.

**Phase 3 - Expected:** Customers routinely ask "Is this a verified receipt?" before paying. Unverified becomes suspicious.

**Phase 4 - Required:** For certain regulated work (gas, electrical, structural), verified receipts become mandatory. Tax authorities require pre-registration for all trade work above threshold amounts.
