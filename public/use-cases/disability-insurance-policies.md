## What is Disability Insurance?

Your most valuable asset isn't your house; it's your **ability to earn an income**. If a surgeon breaks their hand, they lose millions in future earnings. **Disability Insurance** protects that future cash flow.

High-earners keep these **Policy Schedules** for 30+ years. They use them to prove their financial stability to lenders and business partners.

Fraud is high-stakes here: scammers often edit a cheap "Any Occupation" policy to look like a premium "Own Occupation" policy to look more credit-worthy. Verified hashes turn the policy folder into a live, trusted financial link that lasts a lifetime.

## Data Verified

Insured name, specific occupation class, monthly benefit amount, elimination period (waiting time), benefit period (duration), COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) riders, effective date, issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Policy Schedule (Declarations):** The 1-page executive summary.
- **Verification of Insurance (VOI):** 1-page proof for lenders or employers.
- **Rider Activation Notice:** Proving an increase in coverage was purchased.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`unum.com`, `northwesternmutual.com`, `guardianlife.com`) and policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Premium paid; coverage in force.
- **Lapsed** — Coverage terminated due to non-payment.
- **Reduced** — Benefit amount lowered (e.g., due to salary change).
- **In-Claim** — Policyholder is currently receiving benefits.

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder (Professional)** (second party) receives the policy from the insurer (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the income protection policy. Most of the time, the policy sits in their financial records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the policy matches what the insurer's system recorded, including the critical "Own Occupation" definition, and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If they become disabled or a dispute arises about benefits, they have cryptographic proof of the policy terms ready without needing to contact the insurer.

## Third-Party Use

The policyholder (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Mortgage Underwriters**
**Risk De-risking:** Lenders often ignore disability insurance because it's too hard to verify the "Fine Print" (e.g., Own-Occ vs. Any-Occ). Live Verify turns the policy schedule into a verified digital artifact that proves the quality of the insurance.

**Divorce / Legal Settlements**
**Asset Integrity:** Verifying the existence and value of disability policies during asset division to ensure future income potential is accurately accounted for.

**Business Partners**
**Buy-Sell Agreements:** Ensuring that a partner's "Disability Buy-Out" policy is verified active and sufficient to fund the purchase of their shares if they become incapacitated.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Policy" Fraud Problem**

- **Benefit Inflation:** Editing a $2,000 policy to read $20,000 to trick a bank or an ex-spouse into believing the person has higher insured wealth.
- **Definition Tampering:** Changing "Any Occupation" (cheap) to "Own Occupation" (expensive) on the paper policy to look more credit-worthy.
- **Status Faking:** Showing an old "Active" policy paper for a policy that lapsed 3 years ago.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Individual Carriers (Unum, Guardian, MassMutual, Ameritas)
- Specialist Brokers (providing VOI certificates)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Disability insurance policies contain a mix of enumerable and unique values—round dollar benefit amounts ($5K, $10K, $15K per month), standard occupation classes, and publicly known professions. A competitor or adversary in divorce proceedings could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a professional's income protection strategy. More critically, salt prevents unauthorized parties from discovering someone's disability insurance status, which could be used for discrimination or targeting. Salt protects both financial privacy and personal medical information.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Unum underwrites disability income insurance policies for UK individuals and employers.

```
✓ disability.unum.co.uk/verify — Underwrites disability income insurance policies
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK life insurance and pensions firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, occupation class, monthly benefit amount, elimination period, benefit period, effective date) — never insured names, medical information, or claim history — providing non-repudiation of the policy issuance and benefit terms.

## Competition vs. Broker Confirmation

| Feature | Live Verify | Manual Broker Call | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Human.** Prone to errors or social engineering. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Takes 2-3 business days. | **Instant.** |
| **Availability** | **24/7.** Works when offices are closed. | **Restricted.** | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the "Occupation Class." | **Vague.** "Yes, they have a policy." | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Wealth Preservation" Reality. Disability insurance is a foundational asset for doctors and lawyers. They often hold these policies for 30+ years. Live Verify turns the **Physical Policy Folder** into a permanent, verifiable financial link that survives multiple broker changes and office closures.
