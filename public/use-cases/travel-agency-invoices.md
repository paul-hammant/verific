## What are Travel Agency Invoices?

For complex, multi-city trips or luxury vacations, travelers often use a **Travel Agency** to bundle flights, hotels, tours, and transfers into a single **Itinerary & Invoice**.

These documents are high-stakes because they are used as proof of "Intent to Travel" for **Visa Applications** at embassies and for **Corporate Expense Reimbursement**. Fraud is common: people create "Ghost Itineraries" using fake travel agency templates to fraudulently obtain visas or to "double-expense" a trip to their employer. Verified hashes bind the **Full Itinerary Details and Payment Status** to the agency's domain (e.g., `amextravel.com` or `abercrombiekent.com`).

## Data Verified

Invoice number, agency name, traveler name, destination, trip dates, itemized itinerary (flights/hotels), total price, payment status (Paid/Deposit/Pending), IATA/ARC number, agent ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Booking Invoice:** The final bill and receipt.
- **Itinerary Confirmation:** Detailed day-by-day travel plan.
- **Voucher:** Proving payment for a specific hotel or tour.
- **Cancellation Notice:** Proof of refund eligibility.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`elitetravel.com`, `amextravel.com`) and the trip standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Fully Paid** — Booking is confirmed and funds are cleared.
- **Confirmed / Deposit Paid** — Booking is active but final payment is pending.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** The trip has been voided; this document is no longer valid.
- **Amended** — A newer version of the itinerary exists.

## Second-Party Use

The **Traveler (Client)** benefits from verification.

**Visa Approval:** A traveler applying for a Schengen visa can provide the verified hash of their itinerary. Consular officers can instantly see **"FULLY PAID - ELITE TRAVEL PARTNERS"** directly from the agency's domain, removing the common "fake booking" suspicion that leads to visa denials.

**Insurance Claims:** If a trip is interrupted, the traveler provides the verified invoice to their travel insurer. The insurer can instantly verify the "Pre-Paid" value of the trip without needing to call the agency, speeding up the payout.

## Third-Party Use

**Embassies and Consulates**
**Visa Adjudication:** Verifying that "Hotel Bookings" provided by an applicant aren't just "Reservations" that were cancelled 5 minutes after the confirmation was printed. Verified status shows the current live state of the booking.

**Corporate Expense Teams**
**Audit Confidence:** Verifying that a $14,000 "Japan Package" was actually booked through an authorized agency and not fabricated by an employee using a PDF editor.

**Travel Management Companies (TMCs)**
**Reconciliation:** Ensuring that "Leisure" travel booked by employees (which may have corporate-linked perks) is correctly tracked and verified for liability purposes.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Trip" Fraud Problem**

- **Itinerary Inflation:** Changing a $2,000 Economy trip into a $14,000 Business Class trip on an invoice to claim a higher reimbursement.
- **Visa Scams:** Printing "Confirmed" itineraries for travel that has already been cancelled.
- **Template Mimicry:** Using a high-end agency's branding to vouch for a trip that was never booked.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Retail Travel Agencies.**
**Corporate Travel Portals (Concur).**
**Tour Operators.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Traveler names and destinations are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Paparazzi" or data scrapers from tracking high-net-worth travelers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Travel agencies are licensed by ABTA to issue itineraries and invoices under UK travel regulations.

```
✓ invoice.trailfinders.com — Issues travel agency invoices and itineraries
  ✓ abta.com — Regulates UK travel agents
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Travel itineraries are "Soft Contracts." By turning them into verifiable digital bridges, we protect both the traveler's mobility (visas) and the employer's capital (expenses), ensuring that "The Plan" matches "The Reality."

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the travel agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (invoice number, destination, trip dates, itemized itinerary, total price, payment status, IATA number) — never traveler identifying information or payment method details — providing non-repudiation of travel booking issuance and payment status changes.
