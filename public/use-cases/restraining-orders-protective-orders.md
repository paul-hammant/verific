## What is a Restraining Order?

A restraining order is a court order that says: stay away from this person. It is the legal system's most direct tool for protecting someone from violence, stalking, or harassment. The problem is enforcement. When a victim calls police to report a violation, the responding officer needs to verify the order is real and current. When a victim shows the order to a school administrator, a workplace security guard, or a building manager, those people have no way to verify it. And critically -- a person subject to a restraining order may claim the order was dismissed, expired, or never existed.

On the flip side, fake restraining orders are used as weapons. Fabricated orders are presented to schools, employers, or landlords to harass the supposed "respondent" who never appeared in court because the order doesn't exist.

Court and law-enforcement systems remain primary for judges, clerks, and police dispatch. The strong Live Verify case is that schools, employers, landlords, shelters, building managers, and even the protected person themselves are usually outside those systems while still being asked to act on the order.

## Data Verified

Court name, case number, order type (DVRO, civil harassment, stalking, elder abuse), petitioner name, respondent name, date issued, expiration date, conditions summary (stay-away distance, protected locations, no-contact provisions, firearms prohibition), issuing judge.

**NOT included:** Underlying allegations, evidence, testimony, or declarations filed in support of the order.

**Document Types:**
- **Domestic Violence Restraining Order (DVRO):** Protecting against abuse by a spouse, partner, or close family member.
- **Civil Harassment Restraining Order (CHRO):** Non-domestic -- neighbor disputes, workplace harassment, stranger stalking.
- **Elder/Dependent Adult Abuse Restraining Order:** Protecting vulnerable adults.
- **Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO):** Restricting firearm access based on threat assessment.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a status code:

- **ACTIVE** -- Order is in effect. Returns expiration date.
- **MODIFIED** -- Order has been amended (e.g., conditions changed, stay-away distance increased). Active but different from the paper version.
- **EXPIRED** -- Order has reached its expiration date and was not renewed.
- **DISMISSED** -- Order was vacated or dismissed by the court.
- **MUTUAL** -- Mutual restraining order; both parties are restrained. Important for law enforcement to know -- both sides have obligations and protections.
- **VIOLATED** -- A violation has been reported and is under investigation. Critical for escalation.
- **SEALED** -- Order exists but details are sealed (e.g., minor involved). Confirms existence without revealing details.
- **404** -- No matching record. The order is forged or the details don't match.

### Photo in Verification Response

For restraining orders, a photo of the respondent in the verification response has direct safety value. A school administrator receives the order naming "David Garza" — but what does David Garza look like? If the verification response includes the respondent's photo (sourced from the court file, which typically includes one), the administrator can recognise the person on sight without requiring the protected person to provide a photo, which may not be current or may not exist. This is especially relevant for workplace security guards, shelter intake workers, and building managers who need to exclude a specific individual they have never met.

## Second-Party Use

The **Protected Person (Petitioner)** benefits from verification.

**Law Enforcement During a Violation:** The petitioner calls 911 and says "he's outside my house." The responding officer scans the order and instantly confirms it is ACTIVE with a 100-yard stay-away distance. No calling the court clerk. No trusting the paper at face value.

**School Administrators:** Presenting the order to a school principal to keep the respondent away from the children's school. The administrator scans, confirms ACTIVE, and knows the order is real and current -- not something forged to manipulate a custody dispute.

**Workplace Security:** Providing the order to workplace security so they know the respondent is not permitted on the premises. Security can verify independently rather than taking the petitioner's word.

**Landlords and Building Managers:** Presenting to a landlord or property manager, particularly in shared housing situations where the respondent must vacate.

**New Jurisdictions (Interstate Enforcement):** When the petitioner moves to a different state, the order must be enforced under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). A verifiable order eliminates the "I need to call California and check" delay for Texas police.

## Third-Party Use

**Law Enforcement (Primary Enforcement Verifier)**
The most critical third-party user. Officers responding to violation calls, conducting traffic stops where the respondent is near a protected location, or encountering either party during unrelated incidents. Instant verification means the officer acts on confirmed information, not a piece of paper that could be expired, modified, or fake.

**School Administrators**
Keeping the respondent away from children. Schools are frequently caught in custody-adjacent restraining order disputes. Verified orders let administrators enforce with confidence.

**Employers and Workplace Security**
When a respondent approaches the petitioner's workplace. HR and security teams can verify the order without involving the petitioner, who may not want to disclose the situation to coworkers.

**Landlords and Property Managers**
Eviction of the respondent from shared housing, or denying the respondent access to a building where the petitioner lives.

**Firearms Dealers**
Federal law (18 U.S.C. 922(g)(8)) prohibits firearms possession for subjects of active domestic violence restraining orders. A gun dealer verifying a restraining order is a life-safety check. Currently this goes through NICS, but a verifiable order provides an additional, real-time confirmation that the order is active -- not expired, not dismissed.

**Other Courts**
When the petitioner files in a new jurisdiction or the respondent challenges the order in another state.

**Victim Advocates and Shelters**
Verifying order status for safety planning. A shelter intake worker confirming that the order covering a new resident is still active.

**Hospitals and Emergency Rooms**
When both parties arrive separately after an incident. ER staff need to know a restraining order exists to keep the parties separated and to coordinate with law enforcement.

## Verification Architecture -- Restraining Order Fraud

**The Restraining Order Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Orders Used to Harass Respondents:** A fake restraining order is presented to an employer or school to get someone fired, expelled, or evicted. The "respondent" never appeared in court because the order doesn't exist.
- **Dismissed or Expired Orders Presented as Active:** The respondent claims the order was lifted, and it wasn't. Or the petitioner claims the order is active, and it was dismissed last month. Both directions are dangerous.
- **Modified Orders with Old Paper Circulating:** The court changed the conditions -- reduced the stay-away distance, removed a protected location -- but the old paper version is still being enforced.
- **Interstate Enforcement Gaps:** Order issued in California, respondent moves to Texas. Texas police pull over the respondent near the petitioner's new address and have no fast way to verify a California order.
- **The Firearms Angle:** A gun dealer must verify if the buyer is subject to a restraining order. Currently this goes through NICS, which has known gaps and delays. A verifiable order would provide an additional, real-time check at the point of sale.
- **Mutual Orders Misrepresented as One-Sided:** A mutual restraining order means both parties have obligations. One party presents only their protective side to authorities, omitting that they are also restrained.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Courts:** Superior courts, family courts, district courts -- the primary issuers.
**Tribal Courts:** Tribal courts issue protective orders enforceable under VAWA.
**Military Courts:** Military protective orders (MPOs) issued by commanding officers.

## Privacy Salt

Critical. The existence of a restraining order reveals domestic violence, stalking, or harassment. Salt prevents enumeration of who has orders against whom. However, for public safety, law enforcement access must be prioritized -- the privacy model must balance victim safety against respondent privacy. A high-entropy random salt printed on the document ensures that the hash cannot be reverse-engineered or brute-forced to discover whether a specific individual has an order against them.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

UK courts issue restraining orders and protective orders under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and related domestic abuse legislation.

```
✓ courts.gov.uk/protection/verify — UK courts protective and restraining orders
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition

| Feature | Live Verify | NCIC/CJIS (Law Enforcement Databases) | Calling the Court Clerk | Trusting the Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Access** | **Open.** Anyone with the document can verify. | **Restricted.** Law enforcement only. Schools, employers, landlords, firearms dealers have no access. | **Business hours only.** Often unhelpful or unable to confirm. | **None.** No verification at all. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Minutes.** Requires dispatch to run the query, often during a chaotic scene. | **Slow.** Hold times, transfers, clerk may not have the file. | **Instant but unverified.** |
| **Availability** | **24/7.** | **24/7** but requires law enforcement credentials. | **Business hours.** Court clerks don't work nights, weekends, or holidays -- when most violations occur. | **Always available, always unverified.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows MODIFIED, DISMISSED, EXPIRED status. | **Good** but depends on court reporting speed to NCIC. | **Real-time** if the clerk checks the file. | **Frozen in time.** Paper shows the order as it was on the day it was printed. |
| **Civilian Access** | **Yes.** Schools, employers, landlords, shelters, firearms dealers. | **No.** | **Theoretically.** In practice, clerks often refuse to confirm to non-parties. | **Yes, but meaningless.** |

**Why this remains strong:** The gap is civilian verification. Police can eventually verify through NCIC/CJIS, but schools, employers, landlords, firearms dealers, victim shelters, and building managers cannot. That makes protective orders another strong case where the portable document is doing real work outside the native justice systems rather than trying to replace them.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the court's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (case number, order type, petitioner/respondent names, issue date, expiration date, conditions) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the restraining order and its current status. Restraining orders have particular witnessing value because the respondent may later claim they were never served or never knew about the order. A timestamped witness record proves the order existed and was verifiable as of a specific date -- independent of service of process.

## Further Derivations

1. **Emergency/Temporary Protective Orders (EPOs/TPOs):** Ex parte orders issued without the respondent present, often by police or judges after hours. Shorter duration (5-21 days), even more urgent verification need -- the respondent hasn't been to court yet and may not even know the order exists. Verification is critical because these orders expire fast and are frequently replaced by longer-term orders.
2. **Civil Harassment Restraining Orders:** Non-domestic restraining orders covering neighbor disputes, workplace harassment, and stalking by strangers. Same verification architecture, different legal standard (no intimate relationship required). Growing category as courts handle more workplace and online stalking cases.
