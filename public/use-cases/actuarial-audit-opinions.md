## What is an Actuarial Opinion?

Insurance companies don't sell products; they sell promises ("If your house burns down, we pay"). The danger is that they might collect premiums today but not have enough money to pay claims tomorrow.

An **Actuarial Opinion** is a formal certification by a math expert (an Actuary) stating: "I have calculated the numbers, and this insurance company has set aside enough money (reserves) to pay its future claims."

If this document is faked or altered, regulators might let a bankrupt insurance company keep selling policies, leading to disaster.

## Data Verified

Appointed actuary name, qualifications (FCAS/MAAA), valuation date, company subject to opinion, opinion type (Reasonable, Redundant, Excessive, Qualified, No Opinion), ASOP compliance statement.

**Document Types:**
- **Statement of Actuarial Opinion (SAO)**
- **Actuarial Opinion Summary (AOS)**
- **Loss Reserve Specialist Report**

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the actuarial firm) and the current validity.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Opinion was issued by the firm and has not been withdrawn.
- **Withdrawn** — The actuary or firm has retracted the opinion (e.g., due to discovery of data errors).
- **Superseded** — A revised opinion has been issued.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insurance Company** (client) benefits from verification.

**Regulatory Filing:** Proving to state insurance commissioners that the opinion is authentic and from a qualified actuary.

**Rating Agency Review:** Providing A.M. Best or S&P with verified opinions to support financial strength ratings.

**Board Assurance:** Giving directors confidence that the opinion in their board pack is the exact text signed by the external actuary, without modification by management.

## Third-Party Use

**State Insurance Regulators**

**Solvency Monitoring:** Regulators receive thousands of SAOs annually. Systematic hash verification ensures that the PDF filed matches the one issued by the actuarial firm, preventing "edit-and-file" fraud.

**Auditors**

**Financial Statement Audit:** External financial auditors (Big 4) rely on the specialist work of actuaries. Verification confirms the reliance on the specialist is well-founded.

**Reinsurers**

**Treaty Pricing:** Reinsurers reviewing ceding company data need to trust the reserve adequacy opinions. Verification builds trust in the underlying data quality.

## Verification Architecture

**The Actuarial Fraud Problem**

- **Rogue Actuary:** An individual actuary issuing an opinion on firm letterhead without going through the firm's internal peer review or quality assurance process.
- **Management Tampering:** Company management slightly altering the "Risk of Material Adverse Deviation" section to sound less alarming before filing.
- **Qualification Inflation:** An actuary signing an opinion for a line of business they aren't qualified for (e.g., a health actuary signing a property casualty opinion).

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Actuarial Consulting Firms:** (Milliman, Willis Towers Watson, Oliver Wyman, etc.)
**Internal Actuarial Departments:** (For large carriers with internal appointed actuaries)

**Domain Binding Value:**
Binding the opinion to `milliman.com` (for example) proves that the *firm* stands behind the opinion, not just the individual signer. If an actuary goes rogue, the firm won't publish the hash.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Actuaries certify that insurers have set aside sufficient reserves for future claims.

```
✓ actuarial.ey.com/verify — Issues actuarial opinions for insurance reserves
  ✓ frc.org.uk/actuaries — Regulates UK actuarial standards and practice
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the auditing firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (company name, fiscal year, opinion type) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.

## Competition vs. Digital Signatures (PKI)

| Feature | Live Verify | Digital Signature (PKI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Workflow Integration** | **Seamless.** Works on printed copies in board books or scanned PDFs in data rooms. | **Fragile.** Breaks if the PDF is printed, scanned, or flattened. |
| **Verifier Access** | **Universal.** Anyone with a browser. | **Restricted.** Often requires specific software or trust anchors to validate the signature chain. |
| **Revocation** | **Instant.** Issuer removes hash or changes status to WITHDRAWN. | **Complex.** Requires CRL (Certificate Revocation List) or OCSP checking, which often fails in long-term archives. |
| **Firm vs. Individual** | **Firm-Centric.** Binds to the firm's domain. | **Individual-Centric.** Binds to the signer's personal token (unless using expensive corp seals). |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Actuarial opinions travel through many hands: drafted in Word, PDF'd, emailed to client, printed for Board meeting, scanned for regulator, uploaded to data room. PKI signatures rarely survive this journey intact. Live Verify survives printing and scanning, ensuring the *content* remains verifiable at every step.
