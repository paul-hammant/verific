## What is Platform Lending?

In the e-commerce economy, platforms like **Shopify**, **Amazon**, and **Square** know a merchant's daily sales volume better than any bank. They use this data to offer "Instant Financing"—often called **Merchant Cash Advances (MCA)** or Revenue-Based Financing. These are not traditional loans; they are the purchase of future sales at a discount.

These digital agreements are the "Lien on Future Revenue." Fraud is rampant in the "Stacked Debt" market: a merchant might "edit" a Shopify agreement to hide that they already owe $50,000 to Amazon, allowing them to take out another illegal loan they can't afford. Similarly, they might use a fake "Satisfied" letter to hide an active lien. Verified hashes bind the **Advance Amount, Repayment Percentage, and Total Payback** to the platform's domain (e.g., `shopify.com` or `amazon.com`).

## Data Verified

Merchant ID, business legal name, advance ID, funding date, amount advanced (net), total repayment amount (gross), daily remittance percentage, platform name, primary bank account ID (for sweeping), date of UCC-1 filing.

**Document Types:**
- **Financing Agreement:** The primary legal contract.
- **Approval Advice:** (Linked hash) the pre-funding offer.
- **Payoff Confirmation:** Proof that the revenue-share is complete.
- **Daily Remittance Log:** (Linked hash) proving ongoing payments.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`shopify.com`, `amazon.com`, `square.com`) and the financing standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Repaying** — The agreement is valid and funds are being collected daily.
- **Satisfied / Closed** — **ALERT:** The total amount has been repaid; no active lien.
- **In Default** — **CRITICAL:** Merchant has blocked the platform's access to funds.
- **Stacked Debt Alert** — **ALERT:** Multiple active financing agreements detected for this merchant.

## Second-Party Use

The **Merchant** (second party) receives the financing agreement from the platform (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The merchant has their own verified copy of the financing terms. Most of the time, the document sits in their business records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The merchant can confirm at any time that the agreement matches what the platform's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they received it.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about repayment amounts, remittance rates, or early payoff calculations—the merchant has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the platform.

## Third-Party Use

The merchant (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Alternative Lenders (Secondary Financing)**
A merchant who has almost paid off their Shopify advance provides the verified hash to a second lender. The lender can see **"VERIFIED BALANCE: $2,500 REMAINING"** instantly, allowing them to pre-approve a new loan that closes the moment the first one finishes—without calling Shopify.

**Business Buyers (Exit / M&A)**
When selling an e-commerce store, the owner provides verified hashes of all platform debt. "Verified by Shopify" ensures the buyer there are no hidden liens on revenue, allowing the deal to close with cryptographic certainty. Brokers can verify that "Net Income" accurately reflects the cost of capital.

**Factoring Firms (Lien Priority)**
Before advancing against receivables, the factoring firm verifies the exact date of the platform's UCC filing to ensure their own "First Position" status isn't compromised by an undisclosed platform advance.

**Financial Regulators (Complaint / Investigation)**
The merchant submits verified agreements as part of a regulatory complaint about predatory lending terms. The regulator can confirm the exact terms agreed—the platform cannot claim "we never offered that rate."

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Payoff" Fraud Problem**

- **Lien Hiding:** Editing a PDF to turn a "15% Remittance" into a "5% Remittance" to appear more creditworthy.
- **Ghost Payoffs:** Creating a fake "Success" email from Shopify to hide an active $100,000 debt.
- **Identity Mimicry:** Using a high-performing store's ID to cover for a failing store's loan application.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Global E-commerce Platforms (Shopify, Amazon, eBay)
- Point-of-Sale (POS) Providers (Square, Toast, Clover)
- B2B Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) Firms

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Unlike documents with many unpredictable variables, platform lending agreements contain enumerable values—round dollar amounts, standard percentage tiers (5%, 10%, 15%), and publicly known merchant storefronts. A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a rival's debt position and gain unfair market intelligence. Salt protects these trade secrets.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Regulated platform lenders provide verified financing agreements and revenue-based lending confirmations under FCA oversight for merchant lending.

```
✓ lending.example-platform.co.uk/verify — Issues verified platform lending agreements
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK consumer credit firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the lender's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (loan agreement number, loan amount, interest rate, term length, disbursement date, status) — never borrower identifying information or bank account details — providing non-repudiation of platform lending agreement issuance.

## Rationale

Platform lending is the "High-Speed Credit" of the digital age. By turning digital agreements into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the stability of the small-business credit market and ensure that "Financial Health" is based on the digital truth of the ledger, not the creative editing of a PDF.
