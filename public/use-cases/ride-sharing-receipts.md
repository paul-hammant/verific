## What are Ride-Sharing Receipts?

In the modern gig economy, **Ride-Sharing Receipts** (Uber, Lyft) are the highest-volume micro-expenses in corporate travel. Every month, millions of employees submit these emails or PDFs for reimbursement.

Fraud is high-frequency and low-barrier: employees use "Ride Receipt Generator" websites to create fake $45 receipts for trips they never took, or they "edit" a $10 personal trip into a $60 business trip by changing the destination and price in a PDF editor. Verified hashes bind the **Trip ID, Route (Pickup/Drop-off), and Total Fare** to the platform's domain (e.g., `uber.com` or `lyft.com`).

## Data Verified

Trip ID, platform name, rider name, driver name (optional/masked), vehicle license plate, pickup address, drop-off address, date/time, itemized fare, tip amount, total price, payment method (last 4).

**Document Types:**
- **Ride Receipt:** The primary post-trip email/PDF.
- **Business Profile Summary:** Aggregated monthly report.
- **Lost Item Report:** (Linked hash) proving a claim was filed.
- **Safety Incident Report:** (Linked hash) provided to insurers.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uber.com`, `lyft.com`, `freenow.com`) and the trip standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Completed / Paid** — Trip occurred and funds were cleared.
- **Refunded** — **ALERT:** The fare was credited back; expense claim is now void.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Trip was never completed; paper is a fabrication.
- **Split Fare Active** — Total cost was shared; shows the user's individual portion.

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Traveler / Rider** (second party) receives the ride receipt from the platform (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the trip details and fare paid. Most of the time, the document sits in their email or expense folder—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the receipt matches what the platform's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If an expense claim is disputed or tax records are audited, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the ride-sharing platform.

## Third-Party Use

The business traveler / rider (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Corporate Finance Teams**
**Fraud Detection:** Automatically flagging "Generated Receipts." If an employee submits a receipt for a $100 "Black Car" trip, but the verified hash returns **"CANCELLED"** or **"ECONOMY - $15,"** the system flags the fraud instantly without a human ever needing to look at the PDF.

**Tax Authorities (IRS / HMRC)**
**Audit Efficiency:** Verifying millions of "Travel Deductions" by scanning the verified hashes provided by tax-prep software, reducing the need for manual receipt audits.

**Insurance Companies**
**Accident Verification:** Verifying the exact location and status of a ride-share vehicle at the time of a reported collision to determine if the commercial or personal policy is active.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Generator" Fraud Problem**

- **Receipt Fabricators:** Websites that create pixel-perfect Uber/Lyft receipts for any amount.
- **Route Padding:** Changing a short trip to a long one to hide personal errands.
- **Refund Double-Dipping:** Getting a refund from Uber for a "Dirty Car" but still submitting the original full-price receipt for reimbursement.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Global TNC Platforms (Uber, Lyft, Didi)
- Regional Taxi Apps
- Corporate Travel Hubs

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Pickup/Drop-off addresses are highly sensitive private data. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Stalking" or "Pattern Analysis" of individual riders. Even though receipts contain unique trip IDs and timestamps, the specific addresses could be enumerated to track a person's movements, creating serious privacy and safety risks. Salt is mandatory to protect rider location privacy.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues ride-sharing journey receipts

```
✓ receipts.uber.com/verify — Issues ride-sharing journey receipts
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the platform's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (trip ID, fare amount, date/time, payment status) — never plaintext like rider names, driver details, or specific addresses — providing non-repudiation of the ride receipt.

## Rationale

Ride-sharing is the "High-Volume, Low-Trust" frontier of business travel. By turning receipts into verifiable digital bridges, we eliminate the friction of manual auditing and the multi-billion dollar cost of "Micro-Fraud."
