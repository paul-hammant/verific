## What is a Green Card?

In Europe and the Middle East, a **Green Card** is the "International Passport" for car insurance. It proves that your insurance policy covers you when you drive across a national border (e.g., from France into Switzerland).

Customs officers at high-security borders will not let a car enter without seeing a physical Green Card.

Because these cards are required for legal entry, scammers often sell "Fake Green Cards" to high-risk drivers who can't get real insurance. Verified hashes allow border police to scan the paper and see the **verified active status** on the insurer's domain in seconds, stopping uninsured drivers at the gate.

## Data Verified

Policyholder name, vehicle registration number (Plate), make/model, vehicle category, policy effective/expiration dates, country of issuance, covered countries (Green Card Bureau members), issuing carrier (NAIC/Company Code), PASSID reference.

**Document Types:**
- **International Motor Insurance Card:** (The "Green Card").
- **Frontier Insurance:** Temporary coverage for non-standard borders.
- **UK/EU Bail Bond:** (Linked hash) for legal protection after an accident.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`allianz.co.uk`, `axa.fr`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Premium paid; 3rd party liability is verified active.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Policy terminated; driver has no legal cross-border cover.
- **Expired** — The specific trip window has ended.
- **Restricted** — Valid only for specific countries (e.g., Turkey or Russia excluded).

## Second-Party Use

The **Driver (Traveler)** benefits from verification.

**Border Crossing:** Proving to a customs officer at a high-security border (e.g., UK to France, or entering Turkey) that the "Green Card" isn't a fake document created to bypass insurance requirements. A verified hash from the insurer's domain prevents the car from being seized at the border.

**Accident Protection:** If a driver has an accident in a foreign country, they can show the "Verified Active" status to the local police. This prevents them from being arrested for "Driving without Insurance" due to a translation error or clerical mistake.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs / Border Police (Frontex)**
**Enforcement:** Border agents can scan the hash while the car is in the queue. "Verified by Allianz" ensures the driver hasn't "Edited" the dates on a 15-day card to cover a 30-day trip.

**Foreign Police (Roadside)**
**Liability Verification:** Instantly confirming the 3rd party liability status after an international fender-bender, ensuring that the local victim's damages will be covered by the foreign insurer.

**Car Rental Agencies**
**Cross-Border Authorization:** Verifying that a customer's personal insurance actually covers the vehicle for the "Green Card" zone before allowing them to drive into a neighboring country.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Road" Fraud Problem**

- **Date Tampering:** Scammers buying a cheap 1-week policy and editing the PDF to read "1 Year" to avoid paying hundreds in premiums.
- **Ghost Bureaus:** Creating fake "Council of Bureaux" certificates for high-risk drivers who have been blacklisted by legitimate carriers.
- **Country Swapping:** Editing a "Limited" card to include high-risk zones like Morocco or Albania that the actual policy excludes.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Motor Insurers Bureaux:** (e.g., MIB in the UK).
**Global Insurance Carriers:** (Allianz, AXA, Generali).
**Frontier Insurance Vendors.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

The Motor Insurer's Bureau (MIB), regulated by the FCA, issues verified international motor insurance cards for cross-border European travel.

```
✓ greencard.mib.org.uk/verify — Issues international motor insurance green cards
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (valid from and to dates, country code, vehicle registration number, vehicle category, make and model, policyholder name, policy number) — never plaintext driver details — providing non-repudiation of the green card motor insurance certificate.


## Competition vs. Central Databases (MID)

| Feature | Live Verify | MID / National DB (UK) | Paper Green Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cross-Border** | **Universal.** Works via URL across all countries. | **Siloed.** French police can't easily check UK MID. | **Universal.** The global standard. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Visual.** Trusted via stamp. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the checkpoint. | **Slow.** Requires specialized terminal access. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if premium was paid today. | **Laggy.** Often 24-48 hours behind. | **Static.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Checkpoint" reality. A border officer in a booth has about 30 seconds per car. They cannot navigate 20 different national insurance databases in 20 different languages. Live Verify turns the **Existing Global Paper Standard** into a live, high-speed digital dashboard that works across every border, app-free.
