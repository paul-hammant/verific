## Data Verified

Deceased name, policy number, beneficiary name(s), total death benefit amount, date of death (verified), death certificate reference, claim approval date, issuing carrier, payment method (wire/check).

**Document Types:**
- **Notice of Claim Approval:** The final "Go-Ahead" for the payout.
- **Beneficiary Claim Form:** (Linked hash) signed by the survivor.
- **Interim Interest Notice:** For claims taking > 30 days.
- **Settlement Statement:** Detailing tax-free vs taxable components.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`northwesternmutual.com`, `prudential.com`) and current claim status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Claim is legitimate and funds authorized.
- **Paid** — Funds have been transmitted to the beneficiary.
- **In-Contest** — **ALERT:** Multiple parties claiming the same benefit.
- **Denied** — Payout rejected (e.g., due to suicide clause or material misrepresentation).

## Second-Party Use

The **Beneficiary (Survivor)** benefits from verification.

**Bridge Financing:** Proving to a funeral home or a bank that the $1M death benefit is "Verified Approved." This allows the survivor to secure short-term credit for funeral costs or living expenses before the insurance check arrives.

**Mortgage Continuity:** Proving to a lender that the breadwinner's income is being replaced by a verified insurance payout, preventing an immediate foreclosure filing.

## Third-Party Use

**Funeral Homes**
**Payment Assurance:** Before providing a $20,000 service on credit, the funeral director scans the approval hash. "Verified by Northwestern Mutual" gives them the confidence that the beneficiary actually has the funds coming.

**Probate Courts**
**Asset Verification:** Verifying the "Liquid Estate" components during the probate process without needing to wait for a 30-day "Confirmation of Benefits" letter via mail.

**Estate Attorneys**
**Trust Funding:** Ensuring that life insurance payouts are being correctly directed into the verified family trust.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Beneficiary" Fraud Problem**

- **Beneficiary Forgery:** Editing a "Claim Approval" PDF to change the beneficiary name to a fraudster's account.
- **Amount Inflation:** Changing a $10,000 "Small Whole Life" policy to $1,000,000 to trick a lender into a high-value loan.
- **Status Faking:** Showing a "Paid" status on a fake paper notice to hide that the claim was actually denied due to fraud.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Life Insurance Carriers:** (Northwestern Mutual, Prudential, MetLife).
**Third Party Administrators (TPAs).**
**Funeral Home Networks.**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Death benefits involve grieving families and large sums of money. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for people who have recently died or inherited wealth.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Aviva, a regulated life insurance provider, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified life insurance claim notifications and death benefit records.

```
✓ claims.aviva.co.uk/life/verify — Issues verified life insurance claim records
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK life insurance and pensions firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurance carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the death benefit claim approval.

## Competition vs. MIB Group (Medical Information Bureau)

| Feature | Live Verify | MIB Group (Industry DB) | Scanned PDF Notice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Beneficiaries and funeral homes. | **Restricted.** Only for insurance companies. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Timeliness** | **Real-time.** Shows approval *today*. | **Laggy.** Depends on batch uploads. | **Static.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the $ amount. | **None.** For the specific notice. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Time of Need" gap. Life insurance data is notoriously siloed. When a person dies, the family needs to move fast. They don't have access to the carrier's internal DB. Live Verify turn the **Static Approval Letter** into a live digital anchor, ensuring that "Peace of Mind" is a cryptographically verified fact.
