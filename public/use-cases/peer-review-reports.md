## What are Peer Review Reports?

In science and academia, the **Peer Review Report** is the "Filter of Truth." Before a research paper is published in a journal (like *Nature* or *The Lancet*), it is sent to anonymous experts who critique the methodology and data. The resulting report determines whether the paper is accepted, rejected, or needs revision.

These reports are the "Gold Standard" of credibility. Researchers use them to secure tenure, win grants, and prove the impact of their work. Fraud is a growing problem: people create "Fake Reviewer" accounts to approve their own low-quality papers, or they "edit" a rejected report into an "Accepted" one to pad their academic CV. Verified hashes bind the **Manuscript ID, Reviewer Verdict, and Date** to the journal's or the publisher's domain (e.g., `nature.com` or `elsevier.com`).

## Data Verified

Manuscript ID number, journal name, article title, author name(s), reviewer verdict (Accept/Reject/Revise), date of decision, lead editor name, reviewer IDs (masked), summary of findings hash.

**Document Types:**
- **Editorial Decision Letter:** The primary "Accept/Reject" notice.
- **Reviewer Critique Report:** The detailed technical feedback.
- **Certificate of Reviewing:** Proof that a scientist performed the work.
- **Author Response Letter:** (Linked hash) proving changes were made.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`nature.com`, `plos.org`, `science.org`) and the research standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Accepted / Verified** — Manuscript has passed review and is slated for publication.
- **Revisions Active** — Decision is valid; author is currently addressing reviewer feedback.
- **Rejected** — **ALERT:** The paper failed the integrity or quality check.
- **Withdrawn** — **ALERT:** The author has retracted the submission (e.g., due to data errors).

## Second-Party Use

The **Researcher (Author)** benefits from verification.

**Tenure & Promotion:** A junior professor can provide verified "Acceptance Hashes" to their university's promotion committee. "Verified by Nature" provides the committee with the proof needed to credit the impact of the work months before it actually appears in print.

**Pre-Print Credibility:** When posting a study to a "Pre-Print" server (e.g., arXiv), the author can include a verified hash of the ongoing peer-review status to prove that the work is already undergoing rigorous vetting by a reputable journal.

## Third-Party Use

**University Hiring Committees**
**Integrity Filter:** Verifying that a candidate's "Accepted Papers" aren't just "Submissions" or fabricated titles. Live Verify connects the committee directly to the journal's editorial record in seconds.

**Scientific Funding Agencies (NSF / NIH)**
**Progress Tracking:** Verifying that a funded project is meeting its "Publication Milestones" by scanning the verified hashes of the resulting peer-review verdicts.

**News Media / Journalists**
**Fact Checking:** Before reporting on a "Breakthrough Study," a journalist can scan the verified decision letter to ensure the study was actually peer-reviewed and isn't just an un-vetted blog post.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Mill" Fraud Problem**

- **Verdict Inflation:** Changing a "Rejected" letter to "Accepted" on a PDF to qualify for a PhD defense or a job.
- **Reviewer Spoofing:** Creating a fake "Peer Review Report" from a famous expert using a fabricated email/domain.
- **Journal Mimicry:** Using a prestigious journal's branding to vouch for a study published in a "Predatory Journal."

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Academic Publishers.**
**Digital Manuscript Management Systems (e.g., ScholarOne).**
**Open Science Platforms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Manuscript titles and reviewer comments are intellectual property. The hash must be salted to prevent "Research Poaching" or tracking of unpublished ideas.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Journal editors and reviewers certify that research has met scholarly standards.

```
✓ review.nature.com/verify — Publishes peer-reviewed research articles
  ✓ cope.org.uk — Sets ethical standards for peer review and publishing
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Peer review is the "Defense of Science." By turning decision letters into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the integrity of the scholarly record and ensure that academic status is based on real vetting, not creative editing.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the journal's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (manuscript ID, reviewer verdict, decision date) — never manuscript title, reviewer comments, or confidential intellectual property — providing non-repudiation of the editorial decision and an audit trail funding agencies can inspect.
