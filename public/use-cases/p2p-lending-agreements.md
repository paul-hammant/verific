## What is a P2P Lending Agreement?

**Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending** allows individuals or small businesses to borrow money directly from other individuals through platforms like LendingClub or Prosper.

The **Lending Agreement** (or Promissory Note) is the legal contract that says: "Investor Group A lent Person B $10,000 at 8% interest."

**"Loan Padding"** is a common financial fraud where a borrower "edits" a P2P agreement to show a smaller debt than they actually have, or a higher "verified income" stream, to trick a traditional bank into giving them a mortgage. **"Duplicate Financing"** occurs when a borrower uses the same set of un-verified paper documents to take out three different loans from three different platforms at once. Live Verify binds the **Loan ID, Amount, and APR** to the fintech platform's domain.

## Data Verified

Borrower name, Loan ID, Principal amount, Fixed/Variable APR, Monthly payment amount, Loan Term (months), Origination date, Maturity date, Platform ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Promissory Note:** The primary legal contract.
- **Loan Disclosure Statement:** Summarizing fees and TILA (Truth in Lending) math.
- **Payment History Report:** (Linked hash) proving on-time performance.
- **Payoff Letter:** Proving the debt is satisfied.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the P2P platform) and the current loan standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Current** — Payments are up to date; loan is in good standing.
- **Paid in Full** — Debt is satisfied; note is void.
- **Delinquent** — **ALERT:** Payments are > 30 days overdue.
- **Charged Off** — Loan has defaulted; legal collection in progress.

## Second-Party Use

The **Borrower** (second party) receives the promissory note from the P2P platform (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the loan terms. Most of the time, the document sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the note matches what the platform's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about payment terms or if they apply for additional financing, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the platform.

## Third-Party Use

The borrower (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Traditional Banks (Mortgage Lenders)**
**Debt Verification:** Before approving a home loan, the bank scans the P2P agreement. "Verified by LendingClub.com" ensures the borrower hasn't "photoshopped" a $50,000 debt down to $5,000 to hide their true leverage.

**Credit Score Providers (FICO / Vantage)**
**Data Accuracy:** Verifying the granular terms of alternative credit data to ensure the borrower's score accurately reflects their non-bank debt performance.

**Asset-Backed Security (ABS) Investors**
**Portfolio Audit:** Investors buying "bundles" of P2P loans can verify the underlying promissory notes at scale by scanning hashes, ensuring the "Pool" hasn't been corrupted with fake or inflated loans.

## Verification Architecture

**The " FinTech Forgery" Fraud Problem**

- **Balance Deflation:** A borrower editing their P2P dashboard or PDF to hide a large debt from a mortgage underwriter.
- **APR Tampering:** Editing a 25% "Bad Credit" interest rate to look like a 7% "Prime" rate.
- **Phantom Origination:** Creating a fake loan agreement from a real platform to "wash" stolen money or commit identity theft.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- P2P Marketplaces (LendingClub, Prosper, Upstart)
- Private Credit Funds
- B2B Lending Platforms (e.g., Funding Circle)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Unlike documents with many unpredictable variables, P2P lending agreements often contain enumerable values—round dollar amounts ($5k, $10k, $25k), standard APR tiers (6.99%, 8.42%, 12.99%), and common loan terms (36, 60 months). A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer platform lending patterns and borrower risk profiles. Salt protects this sensitive financial intelligence.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Funding Circle, a regulated P2P lending platform, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified peer-to-peer lending agreements and loan confirmations.

```
✓ loans.fundingcircle.com/verify — Issues verified peer-to-peer lending agreements
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK consumer credit firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the P2P lending platform's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (loan IDs, principal amounts, APRs, payment terms, origination dates) — never plaintext such as borrower names — providing non-repudiation of issuing the lending agreement.

## Competition vs. API (Aggregators)

| Feature | Live Verify | Plaid / Yodlee (API) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Platform. | **System-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Share only the *Summary*. | **Low.** Aggregators often scrape full history. | **High.** |
| **Connectivity** | **Offline-Ready.** Proves the paper. | **None.** Requires live API sync. | **Static.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires login/MFA. | **Manual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Loan File" reality. In a mortgage closing, "Paper Artifacts" (PDFs) are still the standard. Lenders don't want to maintain 50 different "Fintech Logins" for every applicant. Live Verify turns the **Static PDF Note** into a live, trusted digital link that carries its own proof of truth into the lender's file.
