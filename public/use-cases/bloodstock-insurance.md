## What is Bloodstock Insurance?

A champion racehorse or a top-tier breeding stallion can be worth **$10 million or more**. Because these animals are fragile, owners buy "Bloodstock" (equine mortality) insurance.

The **Certificate of Insurance** is the financial proof of the horse's value. It is used at auctions (to prove the horse is worth the starting bid) and by banks (who lend money using the horse as collateral).

If an owner "Photoshops" a $100k policy to look like a $10M policy, they can commit massive bank fraud or trick buyers into overpaying for a horse.

## Data Verified

Horse name, pedigree (Sire/Dam), registration number (Weatherbys/Jockey Club), insured value, coverage type (Mortality, AS&I - Accident, Sickness & Infertility), effective dates, syndicate identification.

**Document Types:**
- **Mortality Certificate:** The primary proof of value and coverage.
- **Veterinary Certificate of Health:** Required for policy inception (linked hash).
- **Stallion Infertility Certificate:** For breeding stock valuation.
- **Syndicate Share Certificate:** Proof of partial ownership.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`lloyds-bloodstock.com`, `starr.com`) and policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; horse is covered.
- **Suspended** — Pending veterinary re-exam (e.g., after injury).
- **Claim Paid** — Horse has died; policy settled.
- **Void** — Misrepresentation of value found.

## Second-Party Use

The **Horse Owner** or **Syndicate Manager** benefits from verification.

**Auction Sales:** Proving to potential buyers at Tattersalls or Keeneland that the yearling being sold for $2M is already fully insured for that amount by a top-tier syndicate.

**Breeding Contracts:** Proving to the owner of a champion mare that the stallion has "AS&I" (Infertility) insurance, ensuring that stud fees are protected if the stallion becomes unable to breed.

**International Transit:** Proving coverage to specialized equine air-freight companies (e.g., IRT) during high-stakes transcontinental shipping.

## Third-Party Use

**Auction Houses**
**Seller Vetting:** Verifying the insurance value of horses being consigned. If a seller claims a horse is worth $10M, but the verified insurance is only for $1M, it triggers a red flag for valuation fraud.

**Banks (Lenders)**
**Equine Financing:** Thoroughbreds are often used as collateral for multimillion-dollar loans. Banks verify the "Mortality" insurance to ensure the loan is protected if the horse dies.

**Racecourse Authorities**
**Entry Compliance:** Ensuring all competing horses meet the minimum liability/medical insurance requirements.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Stallion" Fraud Problem**

- **Value Padding:** Editing a $100,000 policy to look like a $1,000,000 policy to inflate the horse's value before a private sale.
- **Hidden Injuries:** Keeping an active mortality certificate while hiding a career-ending injury that has already "Suspended" the actual coverage.
- **Ownership Scams:** Forging a certificate to claim ownership of a famous horse to solicit "investments" in a fake syndicate.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Lloyd's Syndicates:** (Specializing in Bloodstock).
**Managing General Agents (MGAs):** (e.g., Markel, Great American).
**Equine Registries:** (Weatherbys, The Jockey Club).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Lycetts underwrites insurance for thoroughbred and bloodstock animals globally.

```
✓ bloodstock.lycetts.co.uk/verify — Underwrites insurance for thoroughbred and bloodstock animals
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive Lloyd's syndicate's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the bloodstock insurance certificate.


## Competition vs. Registry Databases

| Feature | Live Verify | Jockey Club Registry | Paper Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Value.** Proves the *insured amount*. | **Binds Identity.** Proves *who* the horse is. | **Zero.** Easily faked. |
| **Confidentiality** | **High.** Only the specific policy is verified. | **Low.** Many registries are public or easily queried. | **Medium.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the stable. | **Slow.** Requires login/subscription. | **Instant.** |
| **Financial Link** | **Yes.** Directly links the horse to the money. | **No.** Registries don't track insurance data. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Context. A registry knows the horse's name and parents. But only the Underwriter knows the **Insured Value**. Live Verify turns the "Mortality Certificate" into a real-time financial link that proves exactly how much the horse is worth in the eyes of the market's professional risk-takers.
