## The Impersonation Problem

Every scam that impersonates a real organization follows the same structure:

1. A person or message **claims to represent** a legitimate organization
2. The target **cannot verify** that claim
3. The scammer exploits that gap to extract money, information, or compliance

The channel doesn't matter. The same scam — say, a fake bank fraud alert — can arrive as a phone call, an SMS, an email, a WhatsApp message, a social media DM, or even an in-person visit. The scam is the scam. The channel is just transport.

**Live Verify's principle is simple:** Whenever someone claims to represent a real organization — at any touchpoint, on any channel — the target should be able to demand a verifiable claim bound to that organization's domain. A real representative can produce one. A scammer cannot. The inability to produce a verifiable claim is the red flag.

This document catalogs the major scam types that rely on impersonation, describes where in each scam's lifecycle verification applies, and notes that the channel of contact is a secondary detail — not the defining characteristic.

**Perspective:** This is a recipient-side taxonomy. It is written from the point of view of the person or organization being asked to trust a claimed identity, authority, or demand.

**Verification asymmetry:** Across channels, the common fraud pattern is the same: the impersonator can demand trust immediately, while the target lacks a fast independent way to verify the claim unless the claimed organization can produce a verifiable object bound to its domain.

## Scam Types

### Authority Impersonation

The scammer claims to be a government official or law enforcement officer.

**Government agency threats** — "This is the IRS. You owe back taxes. Pay now with gift cards or face arrest." Also: Social Security ("your number has been suspended"), Medicare ("your coverage is compromised"), courts ("you missed jury duty — pay the fine"), sheriff's office ("there's a warrant for your arrest"). The pattern is always urgency + authority + fear.

- **Channels used:** Phone calls, robocalls, SMS, email, postal mail
- **Where verification applies:** The moment the scammer claims to represent a specific agency. A real IRS agent can produce a verifiable claim from `irs.gov`. A scammer cannot.
- **See also:** [Inbound Call Verification](view.html?doc=inbound-call-verification) for the phone-specific mechanism.

**Law enforcement impersonation** — Criminals pose as police officers, detectives, or federal agents. Used for home invasion ("we have a search warrant"), extortion ("pay the fine or be arrested"), and intimidation of vulnerable communities.

- **Channels used:** Phone calls, in-person visits with fake badges, forged documents
- **Where verification applies:** At every touchpoint. Phone call → demand verification SMS. Badge at the door → scan the verify line. Warrant → scan the verify line.
- **See also:** [Police Officer Verification](view.html?doc=police-officer-verification), [Search Warrants](view.html?doc=search-warrants), [Court Orders](view.html?doc=court-orders-judgments).

**State-actor impersonation** — Foreign intelligence operatives impersonate domestic government officials to intimidate dissidents, journalists, or diaspora communities. Recent reporting has documented Chinese state operatives disguising themselves as US immigration officials to warn dissidents that their public statements "broke the law," and using forged US county court documents to compel social media takedowns of dissident accounts.

- **Channels used:** Phone calls, forged letters and legal documents, social media pressure campaigns, in-person visits
- **Where verification applies:** Any forged document scans against the claimed court's domain and returns 404. Any impersonated official cannot produce a verifiable claim from the claimed agency's domain.

### Financial Impersonation

The scammer claims to represent a bank, brokerage, insurer, or other financial institution.

**Bank fraud department scams** — "We've detected unauthorized activity on your account. To secure it, we need to verify your details." The supreme irony: the scam perfectly mimics the legitimate fraud prevention call. Victims "verify" their account details to the scammer thinking they're protecting themselves.

- **Channels used:** Phone calls, SMS ("Your card has been locked — call this number"), email, app push notifications (via fake apps)
- **Where verification applies:** The moment someone claims to represent your bank. A real bank fraud agent can produce a verifiable claim from `chase.com`. A scammer calling from a spoofed Chase number cannot.

**Debt collection scams** — Fake collectors call about debts that don't exist, demanding immediate payment. Targets people with poor credit, recent immigrants, and the elderly. Legitimate collectors also struggle with credibility — nobody trusts an unknown caller claiming they owe money.

- **Channels used:** Phone calls, letters, emails, SMS
- **Where verification applies:** Any contact claiming to collect a debt should produce a verifiable claim from the collecting agency's domain. (This also helps legitimate collectors establish credibility.)

**Investment / brokerage scams** — Fake "account managers" from fabricated or impersonated brokerages guide victims through fake "investments." Often the endpoint of a pig-butchering long con.

- **Channels used:** Phone calls, Telegram, WhatsApp, email, fake trading platforms
- **Where verification applies:** The "advisor from Fidelity" who can't produce a verifiable claim from `fidelity.com` isn't from Fidelity.

### Relationship-Based Long Cons

The scammer builds trust over weeks or months before introducing the impersonation.

**Pig-butchering (investment fraud)** — Scammers cultivate a relationship via dating apps and messaging platforms, then steer the victim toward a fake investment platform. The channel is social — no one impersonates a real institution *yet*. But eventually the scam must bridge to the real financial system: "My financial advisor at [real firm] can help you set up the account." That transition — from personal relationship to institutional impersonation — is where verification applies.

- **Channels used:** Dating apps → private messaging → phone calls → fake platforms → impersonated "advisors" by phone/email/message
- **Where verification applies:** The moment anyone claims to represent a real financial institution. Everything before that is social engineering beyond Live Verify's scope. Everything after that is verifiable.
- **Key insight:** Live Verify cannot prevent a scammer from befriending someone on Tinder. It *can* prevent the scammer's fake "Fidelity advisor" from being believed.

**Romance scams with authority escalation** — "I'm a US Army officer deployed overseas and I need you to wire money to..." Starts on dating apps, moves to private messaging. Eventually escalates to a fake "military lawyer" or "base commander" who contacts the victim to explain why funds are needed.

- **Channels used:** Dating apps → messaging → phone calls/emails from fake "officials"
- **Where verification applies:** When the fake "military lawyer" or "base commander" contacts the victim. No one at `army.mil` authorized that contact.

### Advance-Fee / 419 Scams

The scammer promises a large payout (inheritance, lottery winnings, business deal, stuck funds) in exchange for upfront fees. Named after the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code that covers fraud, but practiced globally.

**Classic advance-fee fraud** — "I am a barrister representing the estate of a deceased client who shares your surname. You are entitled to $4.7 million. To release the funds, we need you to pay a processing fee of $2,500." The scammer may produce forged bank letters, fake court orders, fraudulent "anti-money laundering certificates," and impersonated correspondence from real law firms or financial institutions.

- **Channels used:** Email (the classic medium), social media DMs, messaging apps, letters, phone calls. Modern variants use WhatsApp and LinkedIn.
- **Where verification applies:** Advance-fee scams almost always involve forged documents from real institutions at some point — a fake letter from "Barclays," a forged court order from "the High Court of Lagos," a fabricated certificate from "the Central Bank of Nigeria." Each of these impersonates a real organization and can be verified (or exposed) against that organization's domain. The "barrister" who can't produce a verifiable claim from a real law firm's domain isn't a barrister.
- **Key insight:** The advance-fee scam's power comes from the escalating chain of official-looking documents. Each fake document (bank letter, court order, tax clearance certificate, anti-terrorism compliance certificate) is a separate impersonation of a real institution — and a separate verification failure point.

**Lottery / prize scams** — "You've won the EuroMillions / Publishers Clearing House / a Google promotion. Pay the tax/fee to claim your prize." Often involves forged letters on real organizations' letterheads.

- **Channels used:** Email, SMS, phone calls, postal mail, social media
- **Where verification applies:** The forged letter from "EuroMillions" or "Google" scans against the claimed organization's domain and returns 404.

**Inheritance scams** — A variant of advance-fee fraud using forged probate documents, fake law firm correspondence, and impersonated bank officials.

- **Channels used:** Email, phone, forged documents
- **Where verification applies:** Every forged document in the chain — the "probate court order," the "bank release letter," the "law firm correspondence" — impersonates a real institution and fails verification.

### Authority Chain Attacks

Multiple fake officials contact the victim in sequence, each reinforcing the others' credibility.

**Multi-actor, multi-channel chains** — A "police officer" calls first, then a "prosecutor" sends a WhatsApp message, then a "bank compliance officer" emails. Each says the others are legitimate. Each uses a different channel. The victim is overwhelmed by the apparent coordination.

- **Channels used:** Deliberately diverse — phone, messaging apps, email, sometimes in-person visits. The variety itself is meant to simulate legitimacy.
- **Where verification applies:** Every link in the chain. Each "official" must independently produce a verifiable claim from their claimed organization's domain. One 404 — on any channel — collapses the entire fiction.
- **Key insight:** Authority chains are *more* vulnerable to Live Verify than single-impersonation scams, because the chain has multiple verification points. The scammer needs to fake N organizations; the victim only needs to catch one.

### Service Impersonation

The scammer claims to represent a utility, tech company, or service provider.

**Utility shutoff threats** — "Your power will be cut off in 2 hours unless you pay now." Exploits the urgency of an essential service.

- **Channels used:** Phone calls, SMS, email, door-to-door
- **Where verification applies:** A real utility contacting you about a real issue can produce a verifiable claim from their domain. A scammer cannot.

**Tech support scams** — "This is Microsoft. Your computer has been compromised." Directs the victim to call a number, visit a site, or grant remote access.

- **Channels used:** Pop-up ads, phone calls, emails, search result ads, cold calls
- **Where verification applies:** At the point the victim is interacting with someone claiming to be from Microsoft. A verifiable claim against `microsoft.com` — or its absence — is the test.

### Extreme Urgency Scams

Scams that exploit panic to bypass rational judgment.

**Virtual kidnapping / ransom** — "We have your daughter. Send $10,000 now or she dies." The victim panics, can't reach their family member (who's fine but has their phone off).

- **Channels used:** Phone calls (almost always — the voice creates urgency), sometimes preceded by texts
- **Where verification applies:** Demand verification. A real law enforcement agency calling about a real emergency can produce a verifiable claim. A scammer cannot. Additionally, if police or the family member's employer can rapidly produce a verified "safe" status, the panic can be defused.

**Accident / emergency notification** — Someone claiming to be from a hospital or police department calls about an injured family member, requesting immediate payment for treatment or bail.

- **Channels used:** Phone calls, sometimes texts
- **Where verification applies:** The hospital or police department can produce a verifiable claim. The scammer cannot.

## The Verification Moment

Across all scam types and all channels, the verification moment is the same:

1. Someone claims to represent a real organization
2. The target asks: **"Prove it"**
3. A real representative produces a verifiable claim from their organization's domain
4. A scammer cannot

The channel — phone, email, text, DM, in-person — determines *how* the verifiable claim is delivered, but not *whether* it's possible:

| Channel | How Verification Works |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Phone call** | Caller presses button → verification SMS/RCS arrives mid-call. See: [Inbound Call Verification](view.html?doc=inbound-call-verification). |
| **SMS / RCS** | Message includes a verify line. Recipient taps it. |
| **Email** | Email includes a verify line in the body. (Complements DKIM/SPF — those verify the sending server, not the claim being made.) |
| **WhatsApp / Telegram / Signal** | Message includes a verify link. Recipient taps it. |
| **Social media DM** | Same as messaging apps. A "customer support" account that can't produce a verifiable claim isn't real. |
| **In-person visit** | Badge or document with a verify line. See: [Cold-Caller Credentials](view.html?doc=cold-caller-credentials), [Police Officer Verification](view.html?doc=police-officer-verification). |
| **Forged document** | Document carries a verify line scanned against the issuing organization's domain. See: [Court Orders](view.html?doc=court-orders-judgments), [Search Warrants](view.html?doc=search-warrants). |

The infrastructure is identical in every case: a claim is made, hashed, and published to the organization's domain. The target verifies against that domain. The channel is just transport.

## What Live Verify Cannot Prevent

Live Verify disrupts impersonation — the moment a scammer claims to represent a real organization. It does **not** address:

- **Pure social engineering** — A scammer who never claims organizational affiliation ("I'm a friend of your son's") operates outside the verification model. There's no domain to verify against.
- **The grooming phase** — In pig-butchering and romance scams, the weeks of personal relationship-building happen before any organization is impersonated. Live Verify cannot prevent someone from being befriended on Tinder.
- **Fabricated organizations** — A scammer who invents "GlobalTrust Investment Partners" and registers `globaltrust-invest.com` can produce verifiable claims against that domain. The victim must still evaluate whether the domain is a real authority for the claimed service. (This is the same trust model as HTTPS — the padlock proves you're talking to `example.com`, not that `example.com` is trustworthy.)
- **Compromised insiders** — A real employee of a real organization who abuses their access. Their verifiable claim is genuine. Insider fraud requires different controls.

These are the boundaries. Within them, the principle holds: impersonation of a real organization, on any channel, is exposed by the inability to produce a verifiable claim against that organization's domain.

## Second-Party Use

The **target of the scam** — the person being contacted.

**The universal test:** "Can you send me something I can verify?" This works regardless of channel. On a phone call, it's "send me a verification text." In an email or message, it's "where's the verify line?" At the door, it's "let me scan your badge."

**Channel-specific guidance:**

- **Phone:** "Can you send me a verification text right now?" (See: [Inbound Call Verification](view.html?doc=inbound-call-verification))
- **SMS/Email/Message:** Look for a verify line. If there isn't one, treat the message as unverified.
- **In-person:** "Can I scan your ID?" (See: [Cold-Caller Credentials](view.html?doc=cold-caller-credentials))
- **Any channel:** If someone claiming to represent an organization cannot produce a verifiable claim against that organization's domain, disengage.

## Third-Party Use

**Telecom companies and messaging platforms** — If legitimate organizations adopt verified contact, platforms can more confidently flag or suppress unverified messages/calls claiming organizational authority.

**Banks and financial institutions** — When a customer reports they were "told by law enforcement" or "their bank" to transfer funds, the institution can ask: "Did you receive a verifiable claim?" This creates a bright line for fraud investigation.

**Elderly and vulnerable person advocates** — The rule is teachable: "If someone says they're from an organization, ask them to prove it. If they can't, hang up / ignore / don't open the door." The specific mechanism varies by channel, but the principle is one sentence.

**Law enforcement** — Verification logs provide evidence of legitimate contact attempts, helping distinguish real investigations from scam reports.

**Social media platforms** — When presented with forged court orders demanding content takedown (as documented in the CNN/OpenAI reporting on Chinese state actors), platforms can verify the document against the claimed court's domain. 404 = ignore the forged order.

## Verification Architecture

**Why Scams Work — The Trust Gap**

Every impersonation scam exploits the same gap: there is no practical way for a civilian to verify, in real time, whether someone represents the organization they claim to represent. The existing alternatives are inadequate:

| Current Advice | Why It Fails |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Check the caller ID" | Caller ID is trivially spoofed |
| "Call them back at the official number" | Scammers provide fake callback numbers; looking up the real number takes time; phone trees are impenetrable |
| "Check the email address" | Spoofed headers, lookalike domains (`chase-security.com` vs `chase.com`) |
| "Look for the padlock in the browser" | Only proves you're connected to a server, not that the server is legitimate for the claimed purpose |
| "Don't click links from unknown senders" | Doesn't help when the sender appears known (spoofed, hacked, or lookalike) |
| "Verify in person" | Impossible for remote contact; and in-person verification faces the same fake-badge problem |

Live Verify fills this gap with a single, channel-agnostic mechanism: a verifiable claim bound to the organization's domain.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Any real organization can issue a verifiable claim from their domain, which immediately exposes a scammer's inability to do so.

```
✓ {organizationalDomain} — Organization the scammer claims to represent
```

Commercial issuer — the real organization's domain reputation is the trust anchor. Scammers cannot create verifiable claims bound to domains they don't control.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Privacy Salt

Where impersonation verification involves case numbers, account references, or other predictable data, the issuer should include a random salt to prevent enumeration. This is particularly important for sealed legal matters and law enforcement cases where the existence of the investigation itself is sensitive.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the claimed organization's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (case numbers, account references, contact timestamps, claim types) — never sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of verifiable claims issued against impersonation scams.

## Further Derivations

1. **AI-generated impersonation** — Deepfake voice and video used to impersonate specific individuals (CEO fraud, family member impersonation). The verification principle extends: can the "CEO" produce a verifiable claim from the company's domain? Can the "family member" verify through a pre-established channel?
2. **Cross-border impersonation** — Foreign actors fabricating legal documents or impersonating officials from a different country's government (the China/OpenAI scenario). Verification against the actual foreign government's domain exposes the fabrication regardless of how convincing the document or caller appears.
