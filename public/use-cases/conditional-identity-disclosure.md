## What is Conditional Identity Disclosure?

Some identity escrow scenarios involve long time horizons and specific trigger conditions—not disputes or incidents, but life events that unlock disclosure rights. The identity is escrowed at time of the original event, potentially disclosed decades later when conditions are met.

This is **identity escrow with time-delayed triggers**—designed for scenarios where the right to know may emerge years after the original transaction.

## Derivation 1: Gamete Donor Identity

**The Problem:**
Sperm and egg donation historically promised anonymity. But:
- DNA testing (23andMe, Ancestry) has made "anonymity" a fiction
- Many donor-conceived people want to know their genetic origins
- Medical history from donors can be life-saving
- Some jurisdictions now mandate disclosure rights at age 18

The current system is a mess: some donors were promised anonymity, some offspring want identity, DNA databases are creating surprise discoveries, and no one controls the process.

**How Conditional Identity Disclosure Helps:**

At time of donation, the donor's identity is verified and escrowed with clear disclosure conditions. Everyone knows the rules upfront.

Escrow ID: DE-2025-0114-7829
Established: January 14, 2025

DONOR: Verified Identity #D-REDACTED
  - Identity verified via government ID
  - Medical history on file (separate escrow)
  - Photo on file (age at donation)

DISCLOSURE CONDITIONS:
  - Offspring reaches age 18: Full disclosure
  - Medical emergency (life-threatening): Medical
    history only, identity withheld unless donor
    consents
  - Donor consents to early contact: At donor's
    discretion

ESCROW HOLDER: FamilyOrigins Trust
Jurisdiction: [State/Country]

<span data-verify-line="donor">verify:familyorigins.org/donor/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="donor"></span></pre>
</div>

**What Gets Escrowed:**
- Full identity (name, contact information, address at time of donation)
- Photo at time of donation
- Medical history (may be separate escrow with different disclosure rules)
- Ethnic/ancestry information
- Number of donations/offspring (for half-sibling awareness)

**Disclosure Triggers:**
- **Age 18:** Automatic right to request identity (in disclosure-right jurisdictions)
- **Medical emergency:** Medical history disclosed; identity requires donor consent or court order
- **Donor death:** May trigger disclosure (depends on donor's advance directive)
- **Mutual consent:** Donor and offspring both want contact

**What Offspring Receives:**
- Confirmation their request is legitimate
- Donor identity (if conditions met)
- Medical history (may have separate conditions)
- Half-sibling count (anonymized unless mutual consent)

**Status Indications:**
- **Escrowed** — Identity on file; no disclosure requests
- **Disclosure Requested** — Offspring has requested; conditions being verified
- **Disclosed** — Identity released to requesting offspring
- **Medical Only** — Medical history released; identity still protected
- **Donor Deceased** — Special handling per donor's directive

**Second-Party Use (Donor):**
- **Clear expectations:** Knows exactly when/how identity may be disclosed
- **Medical updates:** Can update medical history over time
- **Contact preferences:** Can indicate willingness for early contact

**Second-Party Use (Offspring):**
- **Right to know:** Clear path to genetic identity
- **Medical access:** Life-saving information available
- **Half-sibling connection:** Can find genetic relatives (with consent)

**Third-Party Use:**
- **Fertility clinics:** Compliance with disclosure laws
- **Courts:** Verification that proper escrow exists
- **Medical providers:** Access to donor medical history in emergencies

## Derivation 2: Adoption Reunion Registries

**The Problem:**
Adopted individuals and birth parents may want to reconnect, but:
- Sealed records make searching difficult
- One party may want contact while the other doesn't
- Intermediaries are expensive and inconsistent
- DNA surprises create uncontrolled reunions

**How Conditional Identity Disclosure Helps:**

Both parties can register with verified identity. Disclosure happens only when BOTH parties have registered and indicated willingness to connect.

  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="adopt"></span>REUNION REGISTRY ENROLLMENT

Registry ID: RR-2025-0114-4421
Enrolled: January 14, 2025

REGISTRANT: Verified Identity #R-REDACTED
RELATIONSHIP: Birth Parent
SEEKING: Child placed for adoption, 1998

CONTACT PREFERENCE: Open to contact
INFORMATION SHARED: Name, general location, photo

STATUS: Awaiting match
  - No matching registration found yet
  - You will be notified if a match registers

DISCLOSURE CONDITION: Mutual registration only

<span data-verify-line="adopt">verify:reunionregistry.org/r/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="adopt"></span></pre>
</div>

**How It Works:**
1. Either party registers with verified identity
2. Registry searches for matching registration (birth date, location, adoption agency, etc.)
3. If match found AND both parties indicate openness → mutual disclosure
4. If only one party registered → no disclosure; can leave message for future match

**What Gets Escrowed:**
- Verified identity
- Relationship (birth parent, adoptee, sibling)
- Matching criteria (birth date, location, agency, known details)
- Contact preferences (open, cautious, information-only)
- Optional: photo, letter, medical history

**Disclosure Triggers:**
- **Mutual registration:** Both parties registered and open to contact
- **Mutual consent upgrade:** Both agree to more information sharing
- **Death notification:** If one party dies, the other may be notified (if pre-consented)

**What's NOT a Trigger:**
- One-sided request (no disclosure without mutual registration)
- DNA match alone (separate from this registry)
- Court order (sealed adoption records are separate legal matter)

**Contact Preference Levels:**
- **Open:** Share full identity immediately upon match
- **Cautious:** Exchange letters first, then identity if both agree
- **Information only:** Share medical/ancestry info, no identity
- **Notify only:** Alert me if match registers, I'll decide then

**Second-Party Use:**
- **Searchable:** Can register and wait for match
- **Control:** Can set contact preferences
- **Safe:** No disclosure without mutual consent

**Third-Party Use:**
- **Adoption agencies:** Can facilitate registry enrollment at adoption finalization
- **Courts:** May reference registry as part of sealed record access proceedings
- **Genetic counselors:** Can suggest registry for medical history access

## Derivation 3: Safe Deposit / Deceased Estate Access

**The Problem:**
When someone dies, their estate may contain:
- Safe deposit boxes with unknown contents
- Digital accounts with no known passwords
- Physical assets in storage
- Documents relevant to heirs

Current process is slow, expensive, and requires probate court for almost everything.

**How Conditional Identity Disclosure Helps:**

The deceased person pre-registers authorized heirs/executors with escrowed verification. Upon death, verification unlocks access without full probate delays.

Authorization ID: CA-2025-0114-8811
Established: January 14, 2025

GRANTOR: JOHN Q. SMITH (Verified)
ASSET: Safe Deposit Box #4472, First National Bank

AUTHORIZED ACCESSOR:
  Primary: Jane Smith (spouse) - Verified #A-449281
  Secondary: Robert Smith (son) - Verified #A-772918

ACCESS CONDITION: Death of grantor

  - OR via trusted contact confirmation protocol

ESCROW HOLDER: EstatePlan Trust

<span data-verify-line="estate">verify:estateplan.org/access/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="estate"></span></pre>
</div>

**What Gets Escrowed:**
- Grantor's verified identity
- Authorized accessor(s) verified identities
- Asset descriptions and locations
- Access conditions (death, incapacity, specific date)
- Succession order if primary accessor unavailable

**Disclosure/Access Triggers:**
- **Death:** Verified death certificate matching grantor
- **Incapacity:** Medical certification of incapacity (for living trusts)
- **Trusted contact protocol:** If death certificate unavailable, multiple trusted contacts can verify
- **Time-based:** Some assets may have time-based triggers (e.g., letter released 1 year after death)

**What This Replaces/Supplements:**
- Waiting for probate court to appoint executor
- Proving relationship to skeptical bank employees
- Lost safe deposit box keys with no known authorized users
- Digital account recovery with no pre-authorization

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Grantor alive; no access triggered
- **Pending Verification** — Death/incapacity claimed; awaiting verification
- **Access Granted** — Verified accessor may proceed
- **Contested** — Multiple claims or disputes; requires resolution

**Second-Party Use (Grantor):**
- **Peace of mind:** Knows assets will reach intended recipients
- **Bypass delays:** Avoids months of probate for simple access
- **Control:** Can update authorized accessors anytime

**Second-Party Use (Accessor):**
- **Proof of authorization:** Verified document to present to banks, storage facilities
- **Clear process:** Knows exactly what's needed to gain access
- **Speed:** Access in days, not months

**Third-Party Use:**
- **Banks:** Can verify authorization without waiting for court
- **Storage facilities:** Clear protocol for releasing contents
- **Digital platforms:** Framework for account access after death

## Verification Architecture

**Time-Delayed Escrow Characteristics:**

These differ from incident-based identity escrow:

| Incident-Based Escrow | Conditional/Time-Based Escrow |
| :--- | :--- |
| Disclosure triggered by problems | Disclosure triggered by life events |
| Short retention (1-5 years) | Long retention (decades) |
| Parties want to avoid disclosure | Parties may want disclosure |
| Adversarial trigger (dispute, crime) | Non-adversarial trigger (age, death, consent) |

**Long-Term Escrow Challenges:**

- **Escrow provider longevity:** Must outlast the escrow period (decades)
- **Contact information decay:** Addresses, phones change over time
- **Jurisdiction changes:** Laws may change disclosure requirements
- **Technology evolution:** Storage formats, encryption standards evolve

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Multiple escrow copies:** Distributed across providers/jurisdictions
- **Periodic re-verification:** Annual contact with all parties
- **Open standards:** Non-proprietary data formats
- **Legal trust structures:** Escrow held by legal entities with succession plans

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Personal

Escrow platforms verify and hold identity information on behalf of individuals who have consented to conditional disclosure. Authority derives from individual consent and data protection compliance.

```
✓ escrow.example-platform.com/conditional/verify — Manages identity escrow and conditional disclosure services
```

Personal issuer — individual attestation, no regulatory chain.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Considerations

**Donor Identity:**
- UK: Mandatory disclosure at 18 (since 2005)
- Australia: Varies by state; some mandatory
- US: No federal law; varies by state
- Trend: Moving toward disclosure rights

**Adoption Records:**
- Historically sealed in most jurisdictions
- Many states now allow adult adoptee access
- Mutual consent registries widely available
- DNA testing has changed landscape dramatically

**Estate Access:**
- Probate requirements vary by jurisdiction
- Some assets (small accounts, joint property) may bypass probate
- Pre-authorized access speeds process but doesn't replace legal requirements
