## What is an Offshore Good Standing Certificate?

A **Certificate of Good Standing** (also called a Certificate of Compliance or Certificate of Incumbency depending on jurisdiction) is a document issued by an offshore registry confirming that a company is currently registered, has paid its annual fees, and has not been struck off, dissolved, or wound up. It's the corporate equivalent of a clean bill of health.

Banks, counterparties, and regulators demand these certificates constantly. Opening a bank account in Singapore for a BVI company? You need a good standing certificate. Entering a joint venture? The counterparty's lawyers want one. Renewing a fund's registration? The regulator requires one.

The problem: these certificates are trivially forged. They're typically one-page documents with a registry seal, a date, and a company name. A competent forger can produce one in an hour. And because the offshore registries that issue them — BVI Financial Services Commission, Cayman Islands General Registry, Jersey Financial Services Commission — don't offer real-time public lookup for all entity types, the recipient has no practical way to verify the certificate is genuine. They're trusting a PDF.

With Live Verify, the certificate carries a `verify:` line bound to the registry's domain. The bank's compliance officer scans it and gets instant confirmation from the registry itself — not from the company, not from its lawyers, not from its registered agent.

## Data Verified

Company name, company number, date of incorporation, registered agent name, good standing status, date of issue, validity period.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Good Standing:** Confirms entity is active and compliant with registry requirements.
- **Certificate of Incumbency:** Lists current directors, shareholders, and registered agent — proves who controls the company.
- **Certificate of Compliance:** Used in some jurisdictions (Bermuda, Guernsey) as the equivalent of good standing.
- **Registered Agent Certificate:** Agent confirms they act for the company — often bundled with good standing.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`bvifsc.vg`, `ciregistry.gov.ky`, `jfsc.je`, `registrar.gov.bm`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Good Standing** — Entity is active, fees paid, not subject to proceedings.
- **Not in Good Standing** — Fees overdue or compliance failure, but not yet struck off.
- **Struck Off** — Entity removed from register. Certificate is invalid.
- **Dissolved** — Entity has been formally wound up.
- **Restored** — Entity was struck off but has been restored to the register.
- **Expired** — Certificate was valid but the validity window has passed. A new certificate is needed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Company** (or its registered agent acting on its behalf) benefits from verification.

**Bank Account Opening:** The single most common use. Correspondent banks in Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and the US require good standing certificates from offshore entities. A verified certificate from the BVI FSC's own domain eliminates the "is this PDF real?" question that delays account opening by weeks.

**Fund Administration:** When an offshore fund vehicle (Cayman LP, BVI company) needs to onboard with a fund administrator, the administrator requires proof the vehicle exists and is in good standing. Verified certificates make this instant.

**Counterparty Due Diligence:** When entering contracts, joint ventures, or M&A transactions, counterparties demand proof the entity is real and active. A verified certificate settles this without a chain of emails to the registered agent.

## Third-Party Use

**Correspondent Banks**

The biggest impact. Banks face regulatory pressure to verify that offshore entities they bank are real and active. Currently, compliance teams receive PDF certificates that could be forged. De-risking decisions — closing accounts for entire categories of offshore entities — are partly driven by the difficulty of verifying these documents. Live Verify reduces the information asymmetry that drives de-risking.

**Regulators (Home Jurisdiction)**

When HMRC, the IRS, or BaFin investigates a UK/US/German resident's offshore structure, they need to confirm the entity exists. Currently this involves formal inter-governmental requests that take months. A verified certificate provides instant confirmation of basic registry facts.

**Law Firms (Opposing Counsel)**

In cross-border litigation, establishing that an offshore entity exists and is in good standing is a prerequisite for service of process and enforcement. Verified certificates eliminate preliminary disputes about entity status.

**Credit Rating Agencies and Insurers**

When rating structured finance vehicles domiciled offshore, agencies need to confirm the SPV is properly constituted. Insurers writing D&O policies for offshore entities need the same confirmation.

## Verification Architecture

**The Forgery Problem**

- **Wholesale fabrication:** A one-page certificate with a registry seal is trivially forged in any document editor. The seal images are available online from previously issued certificates.
- **Expired certificates presented as current:** Good standing certificates typically have a 90-day validity window. An entity struck off in March presents its January certificate to a new bank in June.
- **Certificates for dissolved entities:** The entity existed when the certificate was issued but has since been dissolved. The certificate is technically authentic but factually stale.
- **Wrong entity, right number:** Forger uses a real company number belonging to a different entity in good standing, paired with a different company name.
- **Registered agent complicity:** In rare cases, the registered agent (who often requests certificates on behalf of clients) provides certificates for entities that are not actually in good standing, because the agent hasn't filed the annual fees but tells the client everything is fine.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Offshore Registries:**
- British Virgin Islands: BVI Financial Services Commission (FSC)
- Cayman Islands: General Registry / Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA)
- Jersey: Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC)
- Guernsey: Guernsey Registry
- Bermuda: Registrar of Companies
- Isle of Man: Companies Registry
- Bahamas: Registrar General's Department
- Mauritius: Corporate and Business Registration Department
- Seychelles: Financial Services Authority
- Panama: Registro Público de Panamá

**Privacy Salt:** Moderate. Company name and number are typically on public registries, but the certificate itself — confirming good standing at a specific date — has commercial sensitivity. Salt prevents enumeration of which entities are actively seeking banking relationships.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Certifies good standing status of offshore registered entities.

```
✓ registry.gov.ky/certificate/verify — Certifies good standing status of offshore registered entities
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition

| Feature | Live Verify | Registry Website Search | Registered Agent Letter | Apostilled Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Proves Document Is Genuine** | **Yes.** Hash verified against registry domain. | **No.** You search separately; no link to the document. | **No.** Agent attests, but isn't the registry. | **No.** Apostille proves the notary is real, not that the certificate is current. |
| **Real-Time Status** | **Yes.** STRUCK OFF returned immediately. | **Varies.** Some registries update daily, some weekly. | **Point in time.** Letter is stale immediately. | **Point in time.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** | **Minutes.** Manual search. | **Days.** Agent drafts and sends. | **Weeks.** Notarization + apostille chain. |
| **Works Offline** | **No.** Needs network. | **No.** | **Yes.** Physical letter. | **Yes.** Physical document. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The apostille chain — which is the current gold standard for cross-border certificate authentication — proves that a notary is real but says nothing about whether the certificate is current. A company struck off yesterday still has a valid apostille from last week. Live Verify's real-time status check is the missing piece.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the registry's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (company number, issue date, validity period, status) — never shareholder names, beneficial owners, or registered agent details — providing non-repudiation of the certificate and an audit trail banks and regulators can inspect.

## Further Derivations

1. **Certificate of Incumbency** — Lists current directors, officers, shareholders, and registered agent. More detailed than good standing — proves who controls the entity. Frequently forged to misrepresent ownership in banking and M&A contexts.

2. **Register of Directors / Register of Members** — Certified extracts from the company's statutory registers. In jurisdictions moving toward public beneficial ownership registers (BVI, Cayman), these certified extracts become key verification documents.

3. **Registered Agent Confirmation of Authority** — The registered agent confirms it acts for the entity and that the entity is in compliance. Distinct from a registry-issued certificate — this is the agent's own attestation, verified against the agent's domain rather than the registry's.
