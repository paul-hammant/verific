## What are Vacation Rental Agreements?

In the short-term rental market (Airbnb, VRBO), the **Rental Agreement** or Booking Summary is the legal contract between the host and the guest. It defines the rules of the stay: the nightly rate, the cleaning fee, the cancellation policy, and the "House Rules" (e.g., "No Parties").

Fraud is rampant in the "Direct Booking" market. Scammers create "Phantom Listings" using photos of real homes and issue fake PDF agreements to steal security deposits. Similarly, guests might "edit" an agreement to remove a "No Pets" rule before showing it to a building manager. Verified hashes bind the **Property Address, Stay Dates, and Total Price** to the platform's or the property manager's domain (e.g., `airbnb.com` or `vacasa.com`).

## Data Verified

Reservation reference number, property address, host name, guest name, stay dates, itemized fees (nightly, cleaning, taxes), total price paid, house rules hash, cancellation policy tier, local occupancy tax ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Booking Confirmation:** The primary electronic receipt.
- **Rental Agreement (Long-Form):** The full legal contract.
- **Check-in Instructions:** (Linked hash) containing door codes.
- **Security Deposit Receipt:** Proof of funds held.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`airbnb.com`, `vrbo.com`, `vacasa.com`) and the booking standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Confirmed / Paid** — Booking is valid and current.
- **Checked In** — Guest is currently on property.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** The booking was voided; access is unauthorized.
- **Disputed** — **ALERT:** An active damage or cleanliness claim is open.

## Second-Party Use

The **Vacationer (Guest)** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Scam Protection:** Before wiring a $1,000 security deposit to a "Direct Host" found on social media, the guest scans the provided agreement hash. If it returns **"VERIFIED - AIRBNB,"** they know the listing is real. If it returns **"UNKNOWN,"** they avoid a "Phantom Rental" scam.

**Building Access:** A guest arriving at a high-end condo building can show the verified hash to the front-desk security. "Verified by Airbnb" ensures the guard that the guest is an authorized short-term tenant and not an interloper, preventing a refusal of entry.

## Third-Party Use

**Building Managers / HOAs**
**Compliance Monitoring:** Verifying that the person staying in Unit 4B actually matches the guest name on the verified Airbnb agreement, ensuring that "Sub-Leasing Scams" aren't occurring in the building.

**Municipal Tax Authorities**
**Occupancy Tax Audit:** Verifying that the "Total Rental Income" reported by a host matches the verified hashes from the platforms, ensuring the city collects the correct "Bed Tax."

**Neighbors / Community**
**Nuisance Enforcement:** A neighbor bothered by a large party can scan the "Guest Posting" (if available). If it returns **"MAX OCCUPANCY: 2,"** they have the cryptographic proof needed to report a house rule violation to the platform.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Malibu Ghost" Fraud Problem**

- **Price Baiting:** Showing a low price on a PDF to get a guest to sign, then demanding "Hidden Fees" at the door.
- **Listing Duplication:** Using photos of a real $5M mansion to sell fake $200/night rentals.
- **Rule Tampering:** Editing a "No Smoking" rule into a "Smoking Allowed" rule to avoid a fine.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Short-Term Rental Platforms.**
**Property Management Companies.**
**Local Government Rental Registries.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Property addresses and guest names are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Tourist Tracking" or "Burglary Mapping" (finding out which homes will be empty).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues vacation rental agreements

```
✓ rental.airbnb.co.uk/verify — Issues vacation rental agreements
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Vacation rentals are "High-Emotion, Low-Trust" transactions. By turning the booking summary into a verifiable digital bridge, we protect the traveler's vacation and the host's property from the high cost of manual dispute resolution and fraud.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive rental platforms' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (reservation reference number, property address, host name, guest name, stay dates, itemized fees, total price paid, house rules hash, cancellation policy tier, local occupancy tax ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the vacation rental agreement.
