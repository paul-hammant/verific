## What is a Court Order?

A **Court Order** is a legal command issued by a judge that compels a person or entity to take a specific action (or stop doing something). It is the "Voice of the Law."

It is used for life-altering events:
1.  **Divorce Decrees:** Dividing assets and ending a marriage.
2.  **Child Support:** Mandating monthly payments.
3.  **Restraining Orders:** Prohibiting contact for safety.
4.  **Writs of Execution:** Authorizing the seizure of property to pay a debt.

**"Judgment Fraud"** is a high-stakes crime. Fraudsters edit "Final Judgments" to change dollar amounts from $5,000 to $50,000, or they create fake "Eviction Orders" to illegally remove tenants. In some cases, criminals forge "Name Change" orders to steal identities.

Live Verify binds the **Judge's name, the Case ID, and the exact verdict text** to the court's official domain. A bank or a police officer can instantly verify that the paper order they are holding matches the **final, un-altered ruling** in the clerk's database.

## Data Verified

Case Number, Court Jurisdiction, Judge Name, Names of Parties, Verdict/Amount (numerical and text), Date of Filing, Clerk ID, specific conditions (e.g., "Effective Immediately").

**Document Types:**
- **Final Judgment:** Resolving a civil lawsuit.
- **Divorce Decree:** Proving marital status and custody.
- **Probate Order:** Authorizing the executor of an estate.
- **Restraining Order:** Law enforcement directive for protection.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — The order is authentic and in full force
- **UNDER_APPEAL** — The order may be stayed or subject to change; proceed with caution
- **VACATED** — A later court action has cancelled this order; do not enforce
- **SUPERSEDED** — An amended order has been issued; this version is outdated
- **404** — Order not found (wrong case number, forged document, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the order itself (e.g., `courts.delaware.gov`).

## Post-Verification Actions

None typically. The verification confirms the order's status; that's the decision point for enforcement.

**Why No Further Action:**

- **Sheriffs/marshals** just need status to decide whether to proceed with enforcement
- **Banks** just need confirmation before obeying a garnishment order
- **Police officers** just need to know if a restraining order is active before making an arrest

The status code is the value. If it's OK, enforce. If it's VACATED or 404, don't. No POST form or additional workflow needed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Winning Party (Plaintiff/Creditor)** benefits from verification.

**Asset Seizure:** Proving to a bank or a sheriff that the "Writ of Execution" is verified and authentic. This prevents the "Verification Call" to the court clerk that often delays the freezing of funds by 24-48 hours, giving the debtor time to hide assets.

**Identity Updates:** Providing a verified "Name Change Order" to the DMV or Social Security office to update records instantly.

## Third-Party Use

**Banks and Financial Institutions**
**Compliance Vetting:** Before obeying a "Garnishment Order," the bank scans the hash. "Verified by Courts.gov" ensures the bank isn't participating in a "Fake Debt" scam designed to drain a customer's account.

**Police Officers**
**Enforcement Decisions:** During a domestic dispute, an officer scans a "Restraining Order" paper. Verification confirms the order is **Active and Not Vacated**, allowing the officer to make an arrest with confidence.

**Landlords and Employers**
**Background Integrity:** Verifying that a "Dismissal Order" provided by a candidate is authentic and not a "Photoshopped" document designed to hide a criminal conviction.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Order" Fraud Problem**

- **Amount Inflation:** Editing a $1,000 small claims judgment to $10,000 to trick a collections agency.
- **Status Faking:** Presenting a "Temporary Order" as a "Final Order" to hide that a trial is still ongoing.
- **Clerk Seal Forgery:** Creating fake "Raised Seals" using a digital template to make a fraudulent order look official.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Court Systems:** (e.g., Delaware Courts, NY Unified Court System).
**Federal Courts:** (PACER integration).
**Clerks of Court.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

UK courts issue court orders and judgments authorized by the Courts Act 2003 and Senior Courts Act 1981.

```
✓ courtsni.gov.uk/verify — UK courts issuing orders and judicial judgments
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the court's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (case number, court jurisdiction, filing date, verdict amount) — never party names, judges' notes, or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the court order and judgment issuance.


## Competition vs. PACER / Online Dockets

| Feature | Live Verify | PACER (Federal) | Paper with Seal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires login, case search, and per-page fees ($). | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **High.** Binds text to status. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Accessibility** | **Open.** Scannable by anyone with the paper. | **Closed.** Requires account and professional knowledge. | **Open.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Court. | **System-Bound.** | **The Paper.** |

**Why this remains strong:** Court dockets remain primary for judges, clerks, and lawyers who can use them directly. The gap is the front line: police officers, bank tellers, landlords, employers, and other recipients of court orders often cannot practically navigate those systems at the moment they need to act. That makes court orders another strong portability case rather than an attempt to replace the docket itself.
