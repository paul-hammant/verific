## What is a Property Condition Disclosure?

When selling a home, the **Seller's Disclosure Statement** is the legally mandatory document where the owner must list all known material defects—such as a leaky roof, a cracked foundation, or past flooding. It is the "Buyer's Shield" in the "Caveat Emptor" (Buyer Beware) world of real estate.

These documents are the primary evidence in post-sale lawsuits. Fraud is high-frequency: sellers often "scrub" a disclosure form to remove mention of a $20,000 foundation issue before showing it to a potential buyer. Similarly, they might "edit" an old inspection report to look like a "Clean" disclosure. Verified hashes bind the **Defect Checklist, Property Address, and Seller Signature** to the real estate portal's or the title company's domain (e.g., `zillow.com` or `firstam.com`).

**Why verification matters here:**

- **The buyer discovers the defect after closing.** Basement flooding that the seller knew about and removed from the disclosure. Foundation cracks that were photographed during inspection and then scrubbed from the form. The buyer now owns a $40,000 problem that should have been negotiated before closing — or that should have caused them to walk away.
- **Protects honest sellers too.** After closing, buyers sometimes claim the seller "hid" defects that were actually disclosed. A verified hash of the original disclosure proves what the seller declared at the time. The seller's defence in a post-sale lawsuit is the hash on the title company's domain, not a he-said-she-said argument over which PDF is authentic.
- **Post-sale litigation is expensive and uncertain.** Proving a document was altered requires forensic analysis, expert witnesses, and years in court. A hash mismatch is immediate and unambiguous.

## Data Verified

Property address, seller name(s), disclosure date, itemized defect list (Roof, Basement, HVAC, etc.), specific "YES/NO" answers for 20+ safety categories, seller signature timestamp, realtor ID, platform ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Seller's Disclosure Statement:** The primary legal form.
- **Lead-Based Paint Disclosure:** For pre-1978 properties.
- **Mold/Radon Remediation Proof:** (Linked hash) showing past work.
- **HOA Disclosure Summary:** Rules and pending assessments.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`zillow.com`, `redfin.com`, `mls-portal.org`) and the disclosure standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Original** — Disclosure matches the version initially signed and uploaded.
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** The seller has updated the disclosure (e.g., a new leak was found).
- **Incomplete** — **ALERT:** Mandatory sections of the disclosure were left blank.
- **Voided** — Disclosure withdrawn by the seller.

## Second-Party Use

The **Buyer (Purchaser)** benefits from verification.

**Pre-Offer Due Diligence:** Before spending $500 on a home inspection, the buyer scans the seller's disclosure hash. "Verified by Springfield Realtors" ensures the buyer that the "Clean" PDF they received from their agent hasn't been "Defect-Scrubbed" by a dishonest seller, protecting them from a "Money Pit" purchase.

**Legal Leverage:** If a buyer discovers a hidden foundation crack after moving in, they can use the verified hash of the original disclosure to prove the seller committed "Material Misrepresentation" in court, making it much easier to win a damages claim.

## Third-Party Use

**Home Inspectors**
**Focus Audit:** An inspector can scan the verified disclosure before arriving at the house. This allows them to focus their attention on "Verified Issues" (like past roof leaks) to ensure they were actually repaired, rather than just hidden with fresh paint.

**Title and Escrow Companies**
**Closing Integrity:** Ensuring that the *final* version of the disclosure (including all amendments) is the one actually signed at the closing table, preventing "Last-Minute Swaps" of the paperwork.

**Real Estate Attorneys**
**Evidence Authentication:** In a dispute over "Non-Disclosure," the attorney verifies the hash to show the exact state of the seller's knowledge at the timestamp of the contract.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Defect Scrubbing" Fraud Problem**

- **Answer Swapping:** Changing a "YES" (Has Leaks) to a "NO" on a PDF before sending it to a buyer.
- **Comment Deletion:** Removing an explanatory note about "Past Mold Remediation" to hide a recurring issue.
- **Page Substitution:** Swapping Page 2 of a disclosure with a page from a different, "cleaner" house.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Real Estate Commissions.**
**Multiple Listing Services (MLS).**
**E-Signature Platforms (DocuSign, Dotloop).**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Defect details and home addresses are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Neighborhood Defect Mapping" by data scrapers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Property condition disclosures are issued by real estate professionals and verified by professional property standards body.

```
✓ disclosure.example-agent.co.uk/verify — Issues seller disclosure statements and property condition reports
  ✓ propertymark.co.uk — Sets standards for UK property professionals
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Property disclosure is about "Informed Consent." By turning static forms into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the buyer's largest-ever investment and the seller's legal reputation, ensuring that the "Truth of the House" is backed by cryptographic proof.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the real estate portal's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (property address, seller name, disclosure date, defect checklist items) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the property condition disclosure.
