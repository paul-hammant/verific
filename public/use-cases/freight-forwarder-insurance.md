## What is Forwarder Insurance?

A **Freight Forwarder** is like a "Travel Agent for Cargo." They don't own the ships or planes, but they manage the entire trip. If they book the wrong flight or forget to file customs papers, they can be sued for the lost value of the goods.

**Freight Forwarder Liability** insurance covers these "Errors & Omissions" (E&O).

Big shippers (like Apple or Samsung) will not hire a forwarder without verified proof of a $500k+ policy. Fraudsters often "Photoshop" their insurance papers to look like they have high limits to win big contracts. Verified hashes turn the certificate into a live, trusted link to the insurer.

## Data Verified

Member name, region of operation, cargo liability limit, E&O (Errors & Omissions) limit, 3rd party liability limit, effective/expiration dates, member ID, issuing specialist underwriter.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Insurance (COI):** Required for all B2B logistics contracts.
- **Errors & Omissions Policy:** Protecting against "Missed Flight" or "Wrong Port" errors.
- **Cargo-Only Policy:** High-value single-shipment coverage.
- **Warehouse Keepers Liability:** Proving the goods are insured while in storage.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ttclub.com`, `chubb.com`, `axa.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Premium paid; member is in good standing.
- **Cancelled** — Coverage has been terminated (High-risk for shippers).
- **Restricted** — Coverage limited to specific countries or cargo types.
- **Expired** — Renewal required.

## Second-Party Use

The **Freight Forwarder** benefits from verification.

**Customer Acquisition:** Proving to a high-value shipper (e.g., Apple or Pfizer) that the $500k cargo liability claim is verified by a top-tier underwriter like TT Club. Shippers won't hand over $1M in high-tech parts without cryptographic certainty that the forwarder is legitimately insured.

**Network Onboarding:** Speeding up the process of joining a global logistics network (e.g., WCA or IATA) by providing a "Verified Insurance Token."

## Third-Party Use

**Shippers (Exporters/Importers)**
**Liability Vetting:** Before signing a service agreement, the shipper scans the forwarder's COI. "Verified by TT Club" ensure the forwarder hasn't "Photoshopped" a $100k policy to read $1M to win the contract.

**Port Authorities / Customs**
**Licensing Compliance:** Many ports require forwarders to have verified liability insurance to operate on the terminal. Instant verification at the gate prevents un-vetted vendors from accessing cargo zones.

**Lenders / Banks**
**Asset Protection:** Verifying the insurance status of a logistics partner before financing a large international trade transaction.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Forwarder" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Policies:** Buying a policy, printing 100 certificates, then cancelling the policy for a refund.
- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a PDF to change "USD 50,000" to "USD 500,000" to qualify for high-value cargo.
- **Endorsement Fabrications:** Claiming a policy covers "Refrigerated Goods" (high risk) when the verified policy actually excludes them.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Specialty Logistics Underwriters:** (TT Club, Gard, AXA XL).
**Global Commercial Carriers.**
**MGA Logistics Specialists.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

The TT Club, a mutual insurer specializing in logistics, is regulated by the FCA and issues verified freight forwarder liability insurance certificates.

```
✓ ff-insurance.ttin.co.uk/verify — Issues freight forwarder liability insurance certificates
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurance carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (certificate numbers, forwarder names, policy limits, expiration dates, coverage types) — never sensitive commercial information — providing non-repudiation of the cargo insurance certificate.

## Competition vs. Broker Confirmation

| Feature | Live Verify | Manual Broker Call | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering or typos. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Limits.** Protects every digit. | **Vague.** "Yes, they are insured." | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often takes 24-48 hours. | **Instant.** |
| **Availability** | **24/7.** Works across all time zones. | **Restricted.** Business hours only. | **Universal.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Time Zone" Reality. Logistics is a 24/7 global business. A shipper in Singapore needs to verify a forwarder in Germany at 2 AM Berlin time. They can't wait for a broker's office to open. Live Verify turns the **Physical COI** into a live, global trust bridge that works at the speed of the supply chain.
