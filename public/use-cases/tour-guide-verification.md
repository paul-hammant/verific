## What is Tour Guide Verification?

For travelers—especially solo travelers and women—hiring a **Tour Guide** or a local host is an act of extreme trust. You are often alone with a stranger in an unfamiliar city, relying on them for navigation and safety.

The problem is that "Tour Guide" is a low-barrier profession. Anyone can buy a generic "Official Guide" badge online or print a fake certificate from a famous travel site (like TripAdvisor or Viator). Even legitimate guides may have had their licenses revoked for safety violations. Live Verify allows a traveler to scan the guide's ID badge to verify: **"Is this person currently licensed by the national tourism board, and have they passed a professional background check?"**

## Framing Insights

**"Why would you bother?" (Pattern A):** A "tour guide" who approaches you at a train station in Lisbon, Marrakech, or Bangkok is not necessarily a guide. Unlicensed operators use this role as cover for theft, scams (leading tourists to overpriced shops for kickbacks), and — in the worst cases — assault. "Official Guide" badges cost a few dollars on AliExpress. The question is not whether legitimate guides exist; it is whether you can distinguish one from a predator wearing the same lanyard.

**Photo catches substitution (Pattern C):** The verified badge includes a photo hash. A guide whose license was revoked for harassment cannot lend their badge to a friend or buy a copy. The photo on the badge must match the person standing in front of you, and the hash confirms the photo has not been swapped. This matters most for solo travelers meeting a guide for the first time in an unfamiliar location.

**Protects both sides (Pattern D):** Licensed guides benefit too. In tourist areas saturated with unlicensed operators, legitimate guides compete against people who undercut on price because they carry no insurance, have no training, and have passed no background check. A verified badge is the guide's proof of professionalism — to the traveler, to heritage sites that restrict access to licensed guides, and to platforms that list them.

## Data Verified

Guide name, license ID, issuing tourism board, photograph (via hash), languages spoken, first aid certification status, insurance policy ID, expiration date, background check timestamp, specialized site access (e.g., "MUSEUM AUTHORIZED").

**Document Types:**
- **Official Guide Badge:** Worn during the tour.
- **Tourism License Certificate:** Displayed in a travel agency.
- **Booking Voucher:** (Linked hash) proving the guide was hired for this session.
- **Liability Insurance Card:** Proof of coverage for accidents.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Guide is currently licensed and in good standing
- **ON_DUTY** — (Optional) Guide is currently assigned to an active booking
- **SUSPENDED** — Credentials temporarily revoked (e.g., due to harassment report); do not proceed
- **REVOKED** — Permanent termination of guide authority; do not hire
- **404** — Badge not found (forged, terminated, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `visitportugal.gov`, `viator.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, travelers may record the tour experience:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

--- Optional Follow-Up ---

You may record details of this guided experience.
You will NEVER be told not to do this or that it is not needed.

--- Tip Your Guide ---

```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Pattern detection:** Guide receiving frequent "concerns" across multiple travelers triggers board review
- **Traveler safety:** Creates contemporaneous record if incidents emerge later
- **Quality signal:** Good guides benefit from consistent positive feedback
- **Destination reputation:** Tourism boards can identify and address problematic guides before bad reviews spread
- **Direct tipping:** Travelers can tip guides digitally without cash exchange; especially valuable when local currency is unfamiliar or ATMs are scarce

**The "Never Discouraged" Principle:**

Guides should never tell travelers "don't bother" or "that's not necessary." Every report is logged. The tourism board can triage later—but the traveler is never made to feel their input isn't wanted. Given the vulnerability of solo travelers (especially in unfamiliar environments), safety concerns should always be respected.

## Second-Party Use

The **Solo Traveler (Guest)** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Harassment Safety:** A woman traveling alone is approached by a "Guide" at a train station. Instead of following him, she scans his badge. If it returns **"ACTIVE - MARCO SILVA,"** she can proceed with a higher level of trust. If it returns **"UNKNOWN,"** she stays in the public area and avoids a potential assault or theft.

**Price Integrity:** In markets with "Bargaining," a traveler can verify that the guide is a "Tier-1 Licensed Pro" to justify paying a higher, set rate over un-licensed, un-vetted locals.

## Third-Party Use

**Heritage Sites / Museums (Access Control)**
**Illicit Guide Prevention:** Many sites (e.g., The Vatican or Machu Picchu) only allow licensed guides. Security staff can instantly scan the badges of people leading groups. Verified hashes ensure the "Guide" hasn't "borrowed" a valid card to bypass the site's strict entry rules.

**Hotels / Concierges**
**Sub-contractor Vetting:** Before a hotel recommends a "Freelance Guide" to a guest, they scan the guide's verified hash. This ensures the hotel's brand is protected by only recommending vetted, insured professionals.

**Travel Marketplaces (e.g., Airbnb Experiences)**
**Continuous Monitoring:** Platforms can automatically scan the hashes of all listed guides. If a guide's license returns **"REVOKED"** in the government database, the platform can instantly de-list them to protect future travelers.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Unofficial Expert" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Scammers using a real guide's name and photo from a public website to create a fake physical badge.
- **Status Hiding:** Continuing to use a "Certified" label after a license was revoked for stealing from a guest.
- **Site Spoofing:** Claiming to be "Museum Authorized" to get higher tips, while actually being banned from the facility.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National/Regional Tourism Boards.**
**International Guide Associations (e.g., WFTGA).**
**Large Travel Platforms (as sub-issuers).**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Guide schedules and locations are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guide Stalking" or harassment by bad actors.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues tour guide certifications

```
✓ guides.example-tours.co.uk/verify — Issues tour guide certifications
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Tourism is a "Reputation Export." By turning guide badges into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the safety of global travelers and the brand of the destination, ensuring that "Local Hospitality" is backed by cryptographic proof.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive tourism boards' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (guide name, license ID, issuing tourism board, photograph hash, languages spoken, first aid certification status, insurance policy ID, expiration date, background check timestamp) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the tour guide license.
