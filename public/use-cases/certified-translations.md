## What is a Certified Translation?

Embassies, courts, and universities won't accept a document (like a Birth Certificate or a Diploma) if it's in a foreign language. You must provide a **Certified Translation**.

A Certified Translation isn't just a translated page; it includes a **Certificate of Accuracy** where a qualified linguist swears that the English version matches the Spanish (or French, etc.) version exactly.

Fraud is common: people often "edit" their translated grades or court records to look better before sending them to a visa officer. Verified hashes ensure that the *text* of the translation hasn't been tampered with since the linguist signed it.

## Data Verified

Translator name, credentials (e.g., ATA certification #), source language, target language, title of original document, subject name, number of pages, date of certification, notary name/commission (if notarized).

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Accuracy:** Attached to the front of the translation.
- **Notarized Translation:** Required for many government filings.
- **Sworn Translation:** (Traducteur Assermenté) common in Europe.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Translation Firm or Platform) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Translation matches the firm's official output.
- **Superseded** — Replaced by a newer version (e.g., due to a correction).
- **Invalid** — Disavowed by the translator (e.g., signature forgery).

## Second-Party Use

The **Linguist / Translation Agency** benefits from verification.

**Reputation Protection:** Ensuring that an unscrupulous client doesn't "edit" the translated PDF (e.g., changing a date or a legal term) while keeping the translator's official signature/seal on the letterhead.

**Business Efficiency:** Reducing the time spent manually confirming "Did you translate this?" phone calls from embassies or courts.

## Third-Party Use

**Embassies / Consulates**
**Visa Adjudication:** Verifying that the birth certificate or marriage license translation hasn't been altered to hide a criminal record or change a name.

**University Admissions**
**Transcript Validation:** Ensuring that the translated "High School Diploma" is exactly what the certified translator issued, preventing grade or degree title inflation.

**Courts / Legal Counsel**
**Evidence Admissibility:** Proving the "Chain of Accuracy" for translated foreign evidence in litigation.

## Verification Architecture

**The "PDF Edit" Fraud Problem**

- **Terms Alteration:** Changing "Guilty" to "Not Guilty" in a translated court record.
- **Grade Inflation:** Editing a translated university transcript to change a "C" to an "A."
- **Fake Agencies:** Creating a fake "Certified Translation" letterhead for an un-certified, unqualified translator.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Translation Agencies:** (e.g., TransPerfect, Lionbridge).
**Independent Linguists:** (ATA Certified translators).
**Online Platforms:** (Rev, Gengo).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Professional translators certify that translations are accurate and complete.

```
✓ translations.example-translators.co.uk/verify — Certifies professional translations and interpretations
  ✓ ciol.org.uk — Accredits professional translators and interpreters
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the translation firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (certificate ID, source and target languages, document type, translator name and credentials, certification date) — never source or translated text — providing non-repudiation of the certification and an audit trail for immigration and legal proceedings.


## Competition vs. Physical Seals / Notarization

| Feature | Live Verify | Notary Seal (Embossed) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects every word. | **Binds Paper.** Doesn't prevent editing the text. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Firm. | **License-Bound.** Trust the Notary. | **Visual.** |
| **User Control** | **High.** Share only the verified doc. | **Medium.** Prone to loss. | **Low.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Manual.** Requires visual expert. | **N/A.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Content Protection. A Notary only proves that "John Smith signed this paper." They do not read the translation or verify its accuracy. Live Verify binds the **actual translated text** to the Translation Firm's domain, ensuring the *message* hasn't been tampered with.
