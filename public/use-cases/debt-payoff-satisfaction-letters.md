## What is a Debt Payoff or Satisfaction Letter?

A satisfaction letter (also called a payoff letter, release letter, or lien release) proves that a debt has been fully paid and the lender's claim has been extinguished. These documents are critical for credit reporting, property transfers, and financial planning.

Fraud is common: altered payoff amounts, fake lien releases, and fraudulent "paid in full" letters are used in real estate fraud and identity theft schemes. Live Verify connects the verifier directly to the lender's domain.

**Why verification matters here:**

- **A fake lien release clears the way for fraudulent property sales.** A seller presents a forged mortgage satisfaction letter to a title company. The title search shows the lien as released. The property sells. The buyer discovers months later that the original mortgage was never paid off — and the lender's lien is still attached to the property.
- **Fake payoff letters conceal debt during lending.** A borrower seeking a new loan presents a fabricated satisfaction letter for an existing debt. The new lender, seeing the debt as "paid," approves a larger loan than the borrower can service. The original debt is still accruing interest.
- **Borrowers need proof their debt is genuinely cleared.** After paying off a student loan, auto loan, or mortgage, the borrower needs authoritative proof that the balance is zero and the lien is released. A verified hash from the lender's domain is that proof — useful for years afterward when applying for new credit, selling property, or disputing credit bureau errors.

## Data Verified

Lender name, loan/account number, borrower name, original loan amount, property/collateral description (if secured), payoff date, final payment amount, lien release status, any remaining obligations.

**Document Types:**
- **Mortgage Satisfaction:** Recorded document releasing property lien.
- **Lien Release:** UCC-3 termination or similar security interest release.
- **Payoff Letter:** Confirmation of loan balance paid to zero.
- **Discharge Notice:** Student loan or bankruptcy discharge confirmation.
- **Title Release:** Vehicle title transferred to owner after payoff.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`firstnationalbank.com`, `studentaid.gov`) and current debt status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Satisfied** — Debt fully paid, lien released.
- **Partial Release** — Some collateral released, debt remains on other property.
- **Disputed** — Payoff amount or completion contested.
- **Reinstated** — Debt reopened due to returned payment, fraud, or error.
- **Superseded** — Replaced by corrected satisfaction (e.g., recording error fixed).

## Second-Party Use

The **Borrower** benefits from verification.

**Property Sale:** Proving clear title to a buyer. Sellers need to show the mortgage was satisfied before transfer. A verified hash from the lender's domain eliminates title company concerns about forged releases.

**Credit Repair:** Disputing erroneous "open" accounts on credit reports. A verified payoff letter provides irrefutable evidence to credit bureaus.

**Refinancing:** When refinancing, borrowers must prove prior liens are cleared. Lenders accept verified satisfaction letters without manual confirmation calls.

## Third-Party Use

**Title Companies / Escrow Officers**
**Fraud Prevention:** Fake lien releases are a significant real estate fraud vector. A forged satisfaction letter lets criminals sell property they don't own or take out second mortgages. Live Verify connects the title company directly to the lender's domain.

**Credit Bureaus (Equifax / Experian / TransUnion)**
**Dispute Resolution:** When borrowers dispute account status, bureaus can instantly verify payoff letters rather than waiting 30 days for lender response.

**Future Lenders**
**Underwriting:** Verifying that disclosed debts are actually paid off before approving new loans.

**County Recorders**
**Recording Integrity:** Some jurisdictions are exploring verified satisfaction letters to prevent fraudulent lien release recordings.

## Verification Architecture

**The Debt Satisfaction Fraud Problem**

- **Forged Releases:** Criminals create fake lien releases to enable property fraud.
- **Amount Alteration:** Changing the payoff amount on legitimate letters to claim "paid in full" when balance remains.
- **Date Manipulation:** Backdating satisfaction letters to avoid foreclosure or judgment liens.
- **Identity Fraud:** Using someone else's payoff letter by changing the borrower name.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Banks and Credit Unions:** Traditional mortgage and auto lenders.
**Servicers:** (Mr. Cooper, Cenlar, LoanCare) service loans on behalf of investors.
**Government:** (FHA, VA, USDA, Federal Student Aid) issue discharge notices.
**Auto Finance Companies:** (Toyota Financial, Ally, Capital One Auto) release titles.
**Private Lenders:** Hard money lenders, private mortgage holders.

**Recording Integration**

Many jurisdictions require satisfaction letters to be recorded with the county recorder. The verification hash could be included in the recorded document, creating a permanent public record tied to the lender's domain.

**Credit Reporting Integration**

Lenders could submit payoff hashes to credit bureaus along with their regular reporting. This creates an independent verification path for consumers disputing account status.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Barclays issues debt satisfaction letters for paid-off loans and credit obligations.

```
✓ loans.barclays.co.uk/satisfaction/verify — Issues debt satisfaction letters for paid loans
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK banks and deposit-takers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the creditor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the satisfaction it issued.
