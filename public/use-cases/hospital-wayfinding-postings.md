## What is a Wayfinding Posting?

Any large building or campus with a high proportion of unfamiliar visitors has the same problem: people get lost, and static signs can't help them.

Hospitals. Universities. Airports. Exhibition centres. Government complexes. Shopping centres. Courthouses. Corporate campuses with visitor traffic. The buildings are large, the layout changes over time, and the people walking the corridors have never been there before — or haven't been since the last refurbishment rearranged everything.

The problem isn't the signage itself — it's that static signs can't tell you where *you* need to go, and they can't update when rooms move. A printed sign is correct on the day it's hung and increasingly wrong thereafter.

The main product here is still the building operator's live navigation service. Live Verify is a complementary layer: every corridor intersection can carry a plain-text posting with a `verify:` line, so a visitor who encounters a physical sign first can bridge into that live navigation system with more tamper transparency than an opaque code alone.

### The Hospital Example

Hospitals are the most acute case. You are standing in a 1970s NHS hospital. The corridor is beige. The sign says "Outpatients" with an arrow that might point left or might point down a corridor that branches three ways. You've been walking for five minutes and you're now less sure where you are than when you started. There's a map on the wall but it was printed before the MRI suite was added in 2014 and before Ward 7 moved to the new wing last year. An elderly patient with a walking frame is trying to read it. A family carrying flowers is arguing about which lift to take. Everyone is lost.

The Royal Free in London has over 30 buildings across a hillside campus. Addenbrooke's in Cambridge sprawls across a site the size of a small town. US hospitals are worse — the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota covers 20 million square feet across a network of buildings, skyways, and subways connected over 130 years of construction.

But universities are just as bad. The University of Oxford has 200+ buildings scattered across a city with no single campus. MIT's Building 10 connects to Building 4 via a corridor that looks identical to the one connecting Building 8 to Building 6. Stanford's 8,000-acre campus has buildings named after donors nobody outside the department has heard of.

Airports are worse under time pressure. Heathrow Terminal 5 is a 15-minute walk from security to some gates. Dallas/Fort Worth covers more ground area than Manhattan Island. A passenger who misreads a sign has a boarding deadline that a hospital visitor doesn't.

## Why Text, Not QR

QR codes are the obvious choice for navigation because they reduce friction sharply. But in a public building with heavy foot traffic and limited supervision, they also have a critical vulnerability: **sticker overlay attacks.**

A malicious QR sticker placed over a legitimate QR code takes seconds to apply, is visually indistinguishable from the original, and redirects every scanner to a different URL. In a hospital context this could mean:

- **Phishing:** Redirect to a fake NHS login page harvesting patient credentials
- **Misdirection:** Send visitors to the wrong part of the hospital (nuisance, but dangerous for someone seeking A&E)
- **Advertising:** Redirect to a commercial service (private ambulance companies, injury lawyers)
- **Data harvesting:** Capture device information and location data from everyone who scans

Plain text on a wall is much harder to tamper with at scale:

1. **Visible tampering.** Replacing an entire printed sign requires removing the old one and mounting a new one — conspicuous in a busy corridor. A QR sticker is invisible.
2. **Human-readable domain.** The `verify:` line shows `nav.royalfree.nhs.uk/v` in plain text. A visitor can read the domain before scanning. A QR code is opaque until decoded.
3. **Hash integrity.** The verification hash covers the entire sign text. Change a single character — move "Outpatients" from "3 min" to "5 min," swap "east" for "west" — and the hash won't match. The verification fails, alerting the scanner that the sign has been altered.
4. **Camera OCR is robust.** Modern phone cameras reliably OCR printed monospace text from a corridor sign at arm's length. No special app needed beyond the standard Live Verify browser extension.

That does **not** mean text always beats QR. The trade-off is:

- **QR:** faster and easier for most visitors
- **Plain text + verification:** more transparent if tamperability and domain legibility matter

In many real deployments, QR may still win on convenience. The Live Verify case is strongest where the operator wants the physical sign itself to be a human-readable, inspectable launch surface into the live navigation system.

## Data Verified

Location identifier (block/level/junction), nearest departments with walking times, nearest facilities (lifts, stairs, toilets), last-updated date, issuing trust/hospital name.

**Document Types:**
- **Corridor junction signs:** The primary wayfinding posting at every intersection.
- **Department entrance signs:** Confirming you've arrived at the right place.
- **Lift lobby directories:** Floor-by-floor department listings.
- **External campus maps:** Mounted at building entrances showing the wider site.
- **Car park level signs:** "You parked on Level 3, Blue Zone" — verifiable reference for finding your car.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a status and a navigation payload:

- **OK** — Sign is current and verified. Response includes structured navigation data.
- **OUTDATED** — Sign content has changed since this version was posted. Response includes the updated version (e.g., Outpatients has moved).
- **DECOMMISSIONED** — This sign location has been removed from the wayfinding system (corridor closed, building demolished).
- **404** — Sign not found. Possible forgery or OCR error.

## Post-Verification Actions

This is where hospital wayfinding becomes genuinely useful rather than merely verified. The verification response includes structured navigation data that the app can act on:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

Location: Block C, Level 2, Junction 7
Coordinates: 51.55632, -0.16548 (building-relative)

--- Navigation Actions ---

Where do you need to go?

Common destinations from here:
1. Outpatients Reception — 3 min walk
2. A&E (Emergency Department) — 4 min walk
3. Main Entrance / Taxi Rank — 5 min walk
4. Maternity Unit — 6 min walk
5. Café / WH Smith — 2 min walk

Select a destination to see step-by-step directions.

Accessibility: All routes have step-free access.
              Accessible toilets: 25m south.
```

**Why this matters:**

The sign on the wall tells you where you are. The verification response tells you how to get where you're going. The app can render turn-by-turn walking directions — "Walk east 30m, turn right at the double doors, take Lift B to Level 0, follow the yellow line 50m to Main Entrance."

This is indoor navigation without Bluetooth beacons, without Wi-Fi triangulation, and without specialised indoor-positioning infrastructure. The signs are the launch surfaces. Every junction scan updates the app's knowledge of where you are by handing off to the operator's live navigation endpoint.

**Progressive navigation:** A visitor scans the sign at the entrance, selects "Cardiology Outpatients," and gets directions. Three junctions later they're unsure — they scan another sign. The app recalculates from the new position. No GPS needed. No battery-draining Bluetooth scanning. Just printed text and a verification endpoint.

## Second-Party Use

The **building operator** (issuer) benefits:

**Reduced front-desk load:** The single most common question at any hospital reception, university porter's lodge, airport information desk, or courthouse security checkpoint is "How do I get to X?" Verifiable wayfinding signs with navigation responses let visitors self-serve, freeing staff for their actual jobs.

**Real-time updates without reprinting:** When a department moves, a lecture room is renumbered, or a gate assignment changes, the operator updates the verification endpoint. The old sign still hangs on the wall, but scanning it returns `OUTDATED` with the new location. The physical sign can be replaced on the next maintenance cycle rather than emergency-reprinted.

**Visitor flow analytics:** Anonymised scan data shows which junctions are most-scanned (confusion hotspots), which destinations are most-searched (demand indicators), and which routes are most-followed (traffic patterns). No personal data needed — just scan counts per sign per hour. A hospital learns where patients get lost; an airport learns where passengers hesitate; a university learns which buildings are hardest to find during freshers' week.

## Third-Party Use

**Visitors and the General Public**
The primary beneficiary. An elderly patient navigating to a clinic appointment. A first-year student looking for a lecture theatre in a building they've never entered. A passenger with 20 minutes until boarding. A family visiting a relative on a ward. A juror finding their courtroom. All currently rely on asking staff, following painted floor lines (which peel and fade), or printed maps that don't fit in a pocket.

**Emergency and Delivery Services**
Paramedics bringing a patient to a specific hospital department. Couriers delivering to a university lab. Maintenance contractors finding a plant room in a government complex. IT engineers locating server rooms. All navigating an unfamiliar building with heavy security restrictions on where they can go and who they can ask.

**Accessibility Advocates**
Verifiable signs can include accessibility data in the navigation response — which routes have step-free access, where accessible toilets are, which lifts are large enough for powered wheelchairs, which corridors have tactile paving. A blind visitor's screen reader can read the verification response aloud: "You are at Block C, Level 2. Accessible lift is 15 metres east." This works identically in a hospital, a university, or an airport — the accessibility data is in the verification response, not on the physical sign.

**Event Attendees**
Exhibition centres (NEC Birmingham, ExCeL London, Javits Center New York) host different events in different halls every week. The layout changes; the signage doesn't keep up. A scan at any junction tells you which hall your event is in and how to get there — without queuing at the information desk with 500 other arrivals.

## Verification Architecture

**The Stale Signage Problem**

Large buildings are not static. Hospital departments merge, split, relocate. University faculties move between buildings. Airport gates get reassigned. Exhibition hall layouts change weekly. Shopping centre tenants come and go. A sign printed in 2019 may point to a department that moved in 2022 to a building that didn't exist in 2019. The sign is not "wrong" — it was correct when posted. It's just stale.

This is different from fraud. Nobody is tampering with corridor signs for profit. The problem is institutional inertia — updating hundreds of signs across a sprawling campus is expensive and slow, so it doesn't happen until a refurbishment forces it. Meanwhile, visitors follow outdated directions.

The core fix is the operator's live navigation service. Live Verify can turn stale signs into trustworthy launch surfaces for that service. The physical text becomes a reference point rather than an instruction, and the verification response provides the current navigation data.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**NHS Foundation Trusts (UK):** Each hospital trust manages its own estate (`nav.royalfree.nhs.uk`, `wayfinding.addenbrookes.nhs.uk`).
**Hospital Systems (US):** Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Kaiser Permanente — large systems with multi-building campuses.
**Universities:** Oxford, Cambridge, MIT, Stanford, Imperial — sprawling sites with buildings named after donors nobody outside the department has heard of. The endpoint is under the university's domain (`nav.imperial.ac.uk`, `maps.mit.edu`).
**Airport Operators:** BAA, Aéroports de Paris, DFW Airport Board. Time-pressured visitors with boarding deadlines. Gate changes mid-journey are the airport equivalent of a department move.
**Exhibition and Convention Centres:** NEC, ExCeL, Javits, McCormick Place. Layouts change weekly. The wayfinding system is the only thing that keeps up.
**Shopping Centres / Malls:** Westfield, Bluewater, Mall of America. "Where did I park?" is the universal question. Tenant churn means the directory board is always slightly wrong.
**Government Buildings and Courts:** HMRC offices, Crown Courts, Social Security offices. Visitors are often anxious, unfamiliar, and on a schedule (hearing times, appointment slots).
**Corporate Campuses with Visitor Traffic:** Tech company headquarters, pharmaceutical R&D sites, financial district office complexes. Visitors arrive for meetings in buildings they've never entered and may not re-enter.

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Wayfinding signs contain no personal data. The content is the same for every visitor. However, if the operator wishes to track individual navigation journeys, those analytics should be opt-in and anonymised. This is primarily a navigation-service design question rather than a document-integrity question.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign (hospitals, airports, government buildings) / Commercial (universities, shopping centres, corporate campuses)

The pattern depends on who operates the building. NHS hospitals and government buildings chain to government. Universities and commercial venues are self-sovereign or chain to an accreditation body.

**Hospital (Sovereign):**
```
✓ nav.royalfree.nhs.uk/verify — Royal Free Hospital indoor navigation service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

**University (Commercial / Accredited):**
```
✓ nav.imperial.ac.uk/verify — Imperial College London campus navigation
```

**Airport (Sovereign):**
```
✓ wayfinding.heathrow.com/verify — Heathrow Airport passenger navigation
  ✓ caa.co.uk — UK Civil Aviation Authority
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

**Government Building (Sovereign):**
```
✓ nav.royalcourts.judiciary.uk/verify — Royal Courts of Justice wayfinding
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the building operator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (sign locations, department mappings, update dates) — never sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of wayfinding sign accuracy.

## Further Derivations

1. **Emergency evacuation routing.** In a fire or other emergency, the verification response switches from normal navigation to evacuation routing: "Nearest fire exit is 40m west. Do NOT use lifts. Follow blue emergency lights." The physical sign stays the same; the response changes based on the trust's emergency status flag. This turns every wayfinding sign into an evacuation guide — no new signage needed.

2. **Accessibility audit trail.** Disability rights organisations can systematically scan every wayfinding sign in a hospital and build a verified map of accessibility features — step-free routes, accessible toilets, hearing loops, tactile paving. The verification response includes this data; the audit produces an evidence-based accessibility report bound to the trust's own domain.
