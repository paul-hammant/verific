## What are Toll Road Receipts?

For commercial drivers and business travelers, **Toll Road Receipts** (e.g., E-ZPass, FasTrak, SunPass) are a major source of micro-expense paperwork. While individual tolls are small ($2 to $25), they can aggregate to thousands of dollars per month for a fleet.

Fraud is high-volume and low-detection: employees use "Toll Receipt Generator" apps to create hundreds of fake $15 receipts for bridges they never crossed. Similarly, rental car agencies often "Estimate" tolls for customers, leading to disputes over the actual amount charged. Verified hashes bind the **Transaction ID, Plaza Location, and License Plate** to the toll authority's domain (e.g., `e-zpassny.com`).

## Data Verified

Transaction ID, account number (masked), transponder ID, license plate, date/time of crossing, plaza/location name, toll amount, vehicle class (e.g., 2-axle), payment status.

**Document Types:**
- **Individual Toll Receipt:** Printed at the booth or generated per crossing.
- **Monthly Usage Statement:** Aggregated list of all tolls.
- **Violation Notice:** For unpaid tolls (verification proves the debt).
- **Rental Car Toll Report:** Issued by Hertz/Avis/Enterprise.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`e-zpassny.com`, `bayareafastrak.org`) and the transaction standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Posted / Paid** — The toll has been successfully charged and cleared.
- **Pending** — Crossing detected but funds not yet settled.
- **Reversed** — **ALERT:** The charge was credited back (e.g., for a billing error).
- **Violation** — **ALERT:** Toll was unpaid; fines are outstanding.

## Second-Party Use

The **Driver / Fleet Manager** benefits from verification.

**Tax Compliance:** A self-employed delivery driver can maintain a verified log of every bridge crossing. During an IRS audit, the verified hashes provide "Audit-Proof" evidence of business mileage and costs, preventing the rejection of deductions due to "Illegible Thermal Paper."

**Rental Dispute:** A traveler can scan the "Toll Report" provided by a rental car agency. If the hash returns **"TRANSACTION NOT FOUND,"** they have the cryptographic proof needed to fight a fraudulent $50 toll convenience fee.

## Third-Party Use

**Corporate Expense Teams**
**Automated Audit:** Platforms like Concur can automatically scan toll receipt hashes. If an employee submits 10 tolls for the same bridge at the same time, the system can instantly flag the duplicates as "Fraudulent" using the verified transaction IDs.

**Logistics / Trucking Audits**
**Route Verification:** Ensuring that a truck actually took the "Toll Route" it was authorized for, and didn't take a slower side-road while pocketing the toll cash.

**Insurance Companies**
**Accident Forensics:** Verifying the exact second a vehicle passed a specific toll plaza to confirm or disprove a driver's statement about their location at the time of a collision.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Receipt" Fraud Problem**

- **Receipt Generators:** Using web tools to create fake E-ZPass receipts for reimbursement.
- **Amount Padding:** Changing a $2.50 off-peak toll to a $16.00 peak-time toll on a PDF.
- **Plate Swapping:** Using a receipt from one vehicle to claim expenses for a second, non-business vehicle.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Toll Authorities.**
**Private Highway Operators.**
**Inter-state Toll Hubs.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. License plates and travel times are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Stalking" or "Surveillance" of individual drivers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues toll road charge receipts

```
✓ receipt.dartcharge.co.uk/verify — Issues toll road charge receipts
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Toll receipts are the "Digital Breadcrumbs" of modern travel. By turning these micro-transactions into verifiable digital bridges, we eliminate the high-volume "Paper Friction" that costs businesses millions in lost time and fraudulent expenses.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the toll authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (transaction ID, date/time, toll amount) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the toll receipt.
