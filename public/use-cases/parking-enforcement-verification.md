## What is Parking Enforcement Verification?

In many cities, **Parking Enforcement Officers (PEOs)** have the power to issue significant fines, order vehicle impoundment (towing), and in some jurisdictions, even collect immediate payments for "boot" removal.

This authority is a magnet for fraudsters. Scammers pose as officers to extort "instant cash fines" from tourists, or they place **Fake Parking Tickets** on windshields that lead to phishing websites or fraudulent payment portals.

Live Verify allows a driver to scan an officer's ID badge or the verification line on a physical ticket to confirm: **"Is this a legitimate municipal official, and is this ticket recorded in the city's official ledger?"**

## Data Verified

Officer name, badge ID, department/agency, photograph (via hash), current duty status, jurisdiction boundaries, citation authority level.

**Document Types:**
- **PEO ID Badge:** Worn on the uniform.
- **Physical Citation (Ticket):** Left on the vehicle.
- **Tow Authorization:** Form presented to the vehicle owner at the impound lot.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Officer is currently on shift and authorized to enforce
- **VERIFIED_CITATION** — (For tickets) citation exists in the official system
- **INACTIVE** — Person is not currently authorized; do not pay any fines to them
- **FRAUD_ALERT** — This ID or ticket number is part of a known scam
- **404** — Badge or citation not found (forged, expired, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `enforcement.sfmta.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, the response includes a verification ID with complaint path:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

--- For Your Records ---
You verified an active SFMTA Parking Enforcement Officer.
Verification ID: VRF-2026-01-12-09:15:22-5523
This verification has been logged by the department.

```

**Why This Pattern (Not a POST Form):**

Parking enforcement — like police verification — has weaponization risk. "Auditors" could abuse a POST form to file frivolous complaints against every officer they encounter. The Verification ID approach:

- **Citizen gets:** One-click complaint path with context pre-filled
- **Department gets:** Pattern detection for harassment (same person verifying multiple officers, complaints immediately after every verification)
- **No free-form POST:** The verification event itself is the record

**Officer Protection:**

Management can identify problematic patterns:
- Person verifying every officer in a district systematically
- Complaints filed within minutes of every verification
- Coordinated campaigns against specific officers or zones

**Driver Protection:**

If an officer demands cash or behaves inappropriately, the driver has:
- Timestamp proof they verified the officer
- Pre-filled complaint form
- Context preserved for the complaint

## Second-Party Use

The **Driver / Vehicle Owner** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Extortion:** A "Parking Officer" approaches a tourist and demands $50 in cash to "forget the ticket." The tourist scans the badge and sees **"ACTIVE DUTY - NO CASH PAYMENTS AUTHORIZED."** This provides the user with the proof needed to refuse the scam and call the real police.

**Ticket Authenticity:** A driver finds a ticket on their windshield with a QR code or URL to pay. Before entering credit card info, they scan the verification hash. If it returns **"UNKNOWN"** or **"DOMAIN MISMATCH,"** they know the ticket is a phishing attempt.

**Towing Disputes:** If a car is being hooked to a tow truck, the owner can verify the authorization form presented by the agent to ensure it's a legal municipal order and not a "Predatory Towing" theft.

## Third-Party Use

**Municipal Courts**
**Evidence Admissibility:** Verifying that the officer who issued a contested ticket was actually assigned to that specific beat/zone at the timestamp of the citation.

**Rental Car Agencies**
**Fine Allocation:** Automatically verifying parking tickets returned with rental cars to ensure they are authentic municipal debts before charging the customer's card.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Yellow Paper" Fraud Problem**

- **Phishing Tickets:** Realistic-looking tickets that direct users to `city-fines-pay.com` instead of the real `.gov` site.
- **Impersonation:** Scammers wearing high-viz vests and buying generic "Security" badges to look official.
- **Outdated Authority:** Former employees using an un-returned ID to "work" for themselves by collecting fake fines.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**City Transportation Departments.**
**Private Parking Operators.**
**University Campus Police.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. The hash must be salted to prevent "Badge Harvesting" or tracking the movements of individual officers by bad actors.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Local authorities employ parking enforcement officers and issue enforcement authority under the Traffic Management Act 2004 and Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.

```
✓ parking.localauthority.gov.uk/officer/verify — Local authority parking enforcement officer badges
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Privacy-Preserving Badge Design

Parking enforcement officers issue dozens of citations daily, each a brief, often confrontational interaction. Their badge is visible to every driver who receives a ticket, plus bystanders and dashcams. Full name exposure creates unnecessary privacy and safety risks — parking disputes can escalate, and officers have been targeted for harassment or retaliation.

**Badge shows:** First name + last initial + ID number (e.g., "Robert M 5523")

**Verification returns:** Photo, current duty status, authorized zone, citation authority level

**Why this works:**
- **Driver gets what they need:** Photo match + confirmation officer is on-duty and authorized
- **Officer privacy protected:** Full name not exposed to every frustrated driver who might seek retaliation
- **Accountability preserved:** Municipality maintains full employment records; citation disputes reference the ID number
- **Audit trail intact:** All verifications logged by the department

This differs from police officers, where full name and badge number are typically required for public accountability. Parking enforcement falls between — they have limited authority (civil citations, not arrests) and face disproportionate harassment risk from the high volume of negative interactions.

## Rationale

PEO verification restores "Trust in the Street." By allowing instant, zero-friction verification of municipal authority, it protects vulnerable populations from extortion and ensures that the city's legitimate revenue isn't diverted to criminals.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the municipality's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (officer name/ID, division, badge authority level) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of officer credential issuance and citation records.
