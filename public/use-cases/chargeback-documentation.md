## What is a Chargeback Adjudication?

When a customer disputes a credit card charge (a "Chargeback"), the merchant must provide evidence (like a FedEx receipt or an IP address) to prove the sale was legitimate.

The **Adjudication Letter** is the final verdict from the payment processor (like PayPal or Stripe) stating: "Dispute Won" or "Dispute Lost."

Merchants need these verified letters to prove to lenders and business partners that their "Fraud Rate" is low. Without verification, a merchant could easily fake a "Dispute Won" letter to hide that they are being victimized by massive amounts of fraud.

## Data Verified

Merchant name, Case ID, disputed amount, transaction date, reason code (Visa/MC standard), evidence summary (Tracking #, IP, AVS match), final resolution status, date of resolution.

**Document Types:**
- **Chargeback Notification:** Initial alert to the merchant.
- **Dispute Response Summary:** The evidence pack sent to the bank.
- **Final Adjudication Letter:** Proving the outcome (Won/Lost).
- **Pre-Arbitration Notice:** For high-value escalations.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`paypal.com`, `stripe.com`, `chase.com`) and case standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Resolved - Won** — Merchant kept the funds.
- **Resolved - Lost** — Funds returned to the cardholder.
- **In-Review** — Evidence submitted; waiting for bank decision.
- **Arbitration Pending** — Escalated to the card network (Visa/MC).

## Second-Party Use

The **Merchant** (Business Owner) benefits from verification.

**Collateralized Lending:** Proving to a lender that a "Reserve Fund" or "Dispute Spike" is temporary and that most recent high-value cases have been "Verified Won." This protects the merchant's credit lines.

**Vendor Trust:** Proving to a supplier that a specific large order wasn't "Fraudulent" but was a verified, settled transaction, ensuring the supplier continues to ship goods.

## Third-Party Use

**Acquiring Banks / Processors**
**Risk Monitoring:** Processors can verify the outcome of disputes across different platforms to build a "Merchant Reputation" profile. Verified wins reduce the merchant's risk score.

**Business Buyers (M&A)**
**Due Diligence:** A buyer of an e-commerce brand needs to verify the "Chargeback Rate" claims. Live Verify allows them to scan random dispute letters to ensure they haven't been "Photoshopped" to hide a 5% fraud rate.

**Credit Card Networks (Visa / Mastercard)**
**Audit Compliance:** Verifying that the evidence submitted by the merchant matches the summary provided to the issuing bank.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Friendly Fraud" Problem**

- **Fabricated Resolutions:** A merchant editing a "Lost" letter to say "Won" to avoid being kicked off a payment platform for high fraud.
- **Evidence Tampering:** Altering a FedEx tracking number on the PDF summary to make it look like a package was delivered when it wasn't.
- **Ghost Cases:** Creating fake dispute notifications to justify "withholding" payments to sub-vendors or affiliates.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Payment Processors:** (PayPal, Stripe, Adyen).
**Acquiring Banks:** (Chase, Wells Fargo, Barclays).
**Dispute Management Platforms:** (Chargebacks911, Chargehound).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Visa processes payment chargeback disputes and documentation for card networks.

```
✓ disputes.visa.com/verify — Processes payment chargeback disputes and documentation
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK payment service providers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the processor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the adjudication it recorded.


## Competition vs. Processor Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | Processor Dashboard | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Control** | **High.** Share one specific case proof. | **Low.** Giving portal access reveals *all* financial data. | **Medium.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Processor. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any bank with a domain. | **Siloed.** Hard to aggregate across multiple processors. | **Universal.** |
| **Permanence** | **Snapshot.** Proves the state at resolution. | **Dynamic.** Data can shift or be archived. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Selective Disclosure. A merchant needs to prove they "Won the Big Dispute" to a lender without giving that lender a password to their entire Stripe account. Live Verify turns the **Adjudication Letter** into a portable, cryptographically trusted "Victory Token."
