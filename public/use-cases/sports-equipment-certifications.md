## What are Equipment Safety Certifications?

In high-impact sports (Football, Hockey, Motorsports), safety equipment—specifically **Helmets**—is the primary defense against traumatic brain injury. Every helmet must meet rigorous safety standards (e.g., **NOCSAE** or **HECC**) and carry an official certification label.

These labels are the "Seal of Survival." Fraud is common in the "Budget Market": manufacturers in unregulated countries create fake "NOCSAE Approved" stickers for low-quality helmets that fail under real-world impact. Similarly, reconditioning firms might "pencil whip" a safety check on a 10-year-old helmet to avoid the cost of disposal. Verified hashes bind the **Manufacturer, Serial Number, and Safety Test Date** to the standards body's or the manufacturer's domain (e.g., `nocsae.org` or `riddell.com`).

## Data Verified

Manufacturer name, model number, unique serial number (shell ID), safety standard ID, certification body (SEI/NOCSAE), test date, expiration of certification, reconditioning history (linked hash), impact-test result hash.

**Document Types:**
- **Equipment Safety Label:** The decal inside the helmet shell.
- **Certificate of Compliance:** Provided to the league/team.
- **Reconditioning Report:** Proof the helmet was tested after a season.
- **Recall Notice:** (Linked hash) marking a specific serial range as unsafe.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`nocsae.org`, `riddell.com`, `bauer.com`) and the safety standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified / Safe** — Product meets current safety standards.
- **Recalled** — **CRITICAL:** The product has a known safety defect; do not use.
- **Retired** — **ALERT:** Helmet has reached the end of its legal life (usually 10 years).
- **Unknown** — Hash not found; high risk of "Counterfeit Safety" fraud.

## Second-Party Use

The **Athlete / Parent** benefits from verification.

**Peace of Mind:** A parent buying a used helmet for their child can scan the internal label. If it returns **"RECALLED - SHELL CRACK RISK,"** they can destroy the helmet and prevent a potential injury.

**League Registration:** Before the first practice, a player can scan their gear. "Verified by NOCSAE" ensures the coach that the player's equipment is legally compliant, protecting the athlete from being "Benched" during a safety audit.

## Third-Party Use

**League Officials / Referees**
**Pre-Game Audit:** Instead of manually checking 100 helmets for tiny date-codes, an official can scan the hashes of a team's roster. Verified hashes eliminate the risk of "Illegal Gear" on the field, which is a major liability for the league.

**Insurance Companies**
**Liability Defense:** If a player is injured, the league's insurer verifies the equipment hashes. If the hash returns **"EXPIRED"** or **"NOT FOUND,"** the league may be held liable for allowing un-certified gear on the field.

**Reconditioning Facilities**
**Chain of Custody:** Verifying that a helmet arriving for repair is actually the "Genuine Original" and not a generic shell with a high-end manufacturer's logo.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Shield" Fraud Problem**

- **Logo Piracy:** Counterfeit manufacturers printing realistic "NOCSAE" logos on non-tested helmets.
- **Date Inflation:** Editing a 2020 reconditioning date to "2026" to keep a worn-out helmet in the game.
- **Serial Masking:** Using one valid serial number from a "Good" helmet to create 1,000 "Verified" labels for 1,000 bad helmets (verification reveals the "Duplicate Registration" alert).

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Safety Standard Bodies (NOCSAE, HECC, ASTM).**
**Equipment Manufacturers (Riddell, Schutt, Bauer).**
**Independent Testing Labs (SEI).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Equipment safety data is generally public safety information. However, individual athlete names associated with specific helmets should be salted to protect minor privacy.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Sports equipment certifiers are accredited by product safety authorities to verify protective gear meets performance standards and prevents life-threatening injuries during athletic competition.

```
✓ equipment.bsigroup.com/verify — Issues verified sports equipment safety certifications
  ✓ opss.gov.uk — Enforces UK product safety standards
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Sports safety is a "No-Failure" zone. By turning equipment labels into verifiable digital bridges, we create a transparent "Shield of Safety" that ensures athletes are protected by the engineering they were promised.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (manufacturer, model number, unique serial number, safety standard ID, certification body, test date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the certification and an audit trail regulators can inspect.
