## Data Verified

Manufacturer name, premises address, product model/part number, serial number range, list of applicable EU Directives/Standards (e.g., LVD, EMC, RoHS), authorized signatory name/title, date of issuance, location of signature.

**Document Types:**
- **EU Declaration of Conformity (DoC):** Required for the CE mark.
- **FCC Declaration:** For radio frequency equipment in the USA.
- **UKCA Declaration:** Post-Brexit standard for the UK market.
- **Certificate of Origin:** (Linked hash) proving where it was built.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`apple.com`, `bosch.de`, `cyberdyne.be`) and current compliance standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Product meets all listed standards and is authorized for sale.
- **Recalled** — **ALERT:** Safety issue found; product must be removed from market.
- **Superseded** — New hardware version or standard update has invalidated this DoC.
- **Invalid** — Model number or directive mismatch.

### Scope enrichment: which standard was actually met

The characteristic DoC fraud is *standard padding* — claiming a stricter standard (e.g. "Medical
Device") than the product was actually tested against ("General Consumer"). A DoC carries no personal
data, so on verification the issuer can safely **echo the exact standards and directives the product
was assessed under**, plus `assessed_on`/`retest_due`. A buyer then sees the *actual* scope of the
declaration rather than a padded label, and cannot read a general-consumer DoC as a medical-grade one.
Safe enrichment — no personal data, revealing the scope the terse claim withheld (see
[safety-certifications](safety-certifications.md) and
[verification-enrichment-hazards.md](../../docs/verification-enrichment-hazards.md)).

## Second-Party Use

The **Importer / Distributor** benefits from verification.

**Customs Clearance:** Proving to an EU Customs officer that the 10,000 robotic hubs being imported have a "Verified DoC" from the manufacturer. Verification prevents the entire shipment from being seized at the port due to a "Suspected Fake CE Certificate."

**Retailer Onboarding:** Proving to a major retailer (e.g., MediaMarkt or Amazon) that the product meets all verified safety laws, reducing the retailer's liability risk.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs & Market Surveillance (EU/HMRC)**
**Enforcement:** Market surveillance officers walking through a store can scan the hash on the product manual. "Verified by Bosch.de" ensures the company hasn't just "Slapped a CE logo" on an un-tested, dangerous electronic product.

**Insurance Companies**
**Product Liability:** Verifying the DoC before writing a policy for a high-risk product (e.g., electric scooters or medical lasers).

**Corporate Procurement**
**Sourcing Compliance:** Ensuring that all hardware being installed in a new office building has verified safety certifications.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake CE" Fraud Problem**

- **China Export Scam:** Using a logo that looks like "CE" but actually means "China Export," and providing a fake paper DoC to trick customs.
- **Standard Padding:** Claiming a product meets "Medical Device" standards on the paper form when it was actually only tested for "General Consumer" use.
- **Date Alteration:** Changing a 2020 DoC to read 2026 to avoid re-testing against new, stricter safety laws.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Manufacturers:** (Hosting on their own `/compliance` domain).
**Testing Houses:** (e.g., TUV, SGS, UL - hosting the verified test reports).
**Authorized Representatives:** (For companies outside the EU/UK).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Manufacturers must declare that products meet applicable safety standards and directives, with declarations subject to product safety authority oversight to prevent unsafe products from reaching markets.

```
✓ doc.siemens.com/verify — Issues verified Declarations of Conformity
  ✓ opss.gov.uk — Enforces UK product safety standards
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the manufacturer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (product names, model numbers, applicable directives, harmonized standards, declaration dates) — never technical specifications or trade secrets — providing non-repudiation of the declaration of conformity.

## Competition vs. QR Redirects

| Feature | Live Verify | Standard QR Code Redirect | Scanned PDF DoC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Manufacturer. | **Data-Only.** QR can redirect to any fake URL. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Directives*. | **Vulnerable.** The landing page can be edited. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Text remains verifiable for 15 years. | **Low.** QR stickers get scratched or fade. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **User Control** | **Targeted.** Verifies the *Exact Version*. | **General.** Often links to a generic "Help" page. | **Full.** But untrusted. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Product Manual" reality. DoCs are usually buried at the back of a printed manual. QR codes on stickers often don't last the 10-year life of a product. Live Verify turns the **Printed Text of the Manual** into a live, high-authority digital anchor, ensuring that safety trust is as durable as the product itself.
