## Framing Insights

**Specific consequences (Pattern E):** A radiologist who performs an MRI on a patient with an "MRI Unsafe" pacemaker can kill them. The magnetic field can heat the device leads, move the generator, or reset the firmware. This is not a theoretical risk — it is a known cause of patient death. The radiologist's only protection is the wallet card the patient carries, and that card is a piece of unverifiable paper. If the card has been forged, altered, or belongs to someone else, the radiologist has no way to know until the patient is in the bore. A `verify:` line that returns "MRI Conditional — Verified by Medtronic" is the difference between proceeding safely and a catastrophic outcome.

**Protects both sides (Pattern D):** The patient needs the scan. The radiologist needs to know the implant is safe for MRI. Without verification, radiologists routinely refuse scans for patients with implants — not because the device is unsafe, but because they cannot confirm it is safe. Patients wait weeks for manufacturer phone calls or surgical records. Verification unlocks access to care for the patient and removes legal exposure for the radiologist, in one scan.

## Data Verified

Patient name, date of birth, device serial number, UDI (Unique Device Identifier), implanting surgeon name, hospital/facility ID, date of implantation, MRI safety status (e.g., "MRI Conditional"), issuing manufacturer name.

**Document Types:**
- **Patient Implant Card:** Carried in the wallet for life.
- **Surgical Implant Log:** (Linked hash) from the hospital's EMR.
- **Device Registration Confirmation:** Proving the warranty is active.
- **Recall Notice:** (Linked hash) proving the specific serial number status.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`medtronic.com`, `bostonscientific.com`, `stryker.com`) and current device standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Device record matches the manufacturer's secure ledger.
- **Recall Active** — **ALERT:** This specific serial number is subject to a mandatory safety recall.
- **Battery Alert** — (For active devices) End-of-service warning verified.
- **Invalid** — Serial number or patient data mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient (Implant Recipient)** benefits from verification.

**MRI Safety:** Proving to a radiologist that their deep brain stimulator or pacemaker is "Verified MRI Conditional." Radiologists are extremely risk-averse; a verified hash from the manufacturer provides the immediate confidence needed to proceed with a life-saving scan without waiting for a manual phone call to the manufacturer's tech support.

**Emergency Care:** Proving their device details to an ER doctor in a foreign city or hospital, ensuring they don't receive treatments (like defibrillation or electrocautery) that could damage the implant.

## Third-Party Use

**Radiology Departments (MRI/CT)**
**Safety Triage:** Instantly verifying the "MRI Conditionality" of a patient's implant. Live Verify connects the tech directly to the manufacturer's safety database, bypassing the "Manual Model Lookup" bottleneck.

**Airport Security (TSA)**
**Expedited Screening:** Verifying the "Implant Status" of a traveler who cannot go through a standard metal detector, reducing the friction of a manual pat-down.

**Medical Device Manufacturers**
**Post-Market Surveillance:** Ensuring 100% accurate tracking of high-risk implants throughout the patient's lifetime for recall and safety monitoring.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Serial Swap" Fraud Problem**

- **Recall Hiding:** A manufacturer or clinic attempting to hide that a specific serial number is part of a defective batch. Verification shows the "Recall Active" flag instantly.
- **Component Forgery:** Creating a fake card for a non-existent or un-vetted implant to justify a medical insurance claim.
- **Status Misrepresentation:** Editing a card to say "MRI Safe" when the device is actually "MRI Unsafe."

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Medical Device Manufacturers:** (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Stryker).
**Hospitals & Surgical Centers.**
**Global UDI Databases:** (e.g., GUDID - hosting the master device hashes).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Implant data is highly sensitive health info. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Scraping" of patient identities linked to specific expensive medical devices.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Medical device manufacturers issue implant cards under healthcare products regulator authority (MHRA in the UK).

```
✓ implants.medtronic.com/verify — Issues medical device implant cards
  ✓ mhra.gov.uk — Regulates UK medicines and medical devices
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the device manufacturer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the implant card.

## Competition vs. UDI Barcodes

| Feature | Live Verify | GS1 / UDI Barcode | Physical Implant Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Manufacturer. | **Self-Contained.** Trust the data *on* the sticker. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if recalled *today*. | **Static.** Only shows what was printed years ago. | **Static.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Serial #*. | **Medium.** Easy to clone a barcode. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Specialized.** Requires 2D barcode scanners. | **Visual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Wallet Reality." Patients carry a card, not a barcode scanner. While the *box* has a UDI barcode, the *patient* only has the paper card. Live Verify turn that **Wallet Card** into a live safety portal, bringing "UDI-level" security to the patient's everyday life.
