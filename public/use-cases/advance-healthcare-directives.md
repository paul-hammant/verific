## What is an Advance Directive?

An **Advance Healthcare Directive** (or Living Will) is a legal document where you tell doctors what to do if you can't speak for yourself (e.g., you are in a coma).

It typically covers:
1.  **The Agent:** "Who decides for me?" (Medical Power of Attorney).
2.  **The Wishes:** "Do I want a ventilator? CPR? Artificial feeding?"

Doctors in the ER need to see this *immediately* to know whether to resuscitate. Paper copies are often lost, locked away, or outdated, leading to unwanted treatments or agonizing delays.

## Framing Insights

**Specific consequences (Pattern E):** An ER doctor who ignores a valid DNR and resuscitates a patient subjects them to exactly the suffering they legally chose to avoid — broken ribs from chest compressions, ventilator dependence, prolonged dying in an ICU. An ER doctor who honors a forged or outdated directive and withholds treatment lets a patient die who wanted to live. Both outcomes are catastrophic and both happen because the doctor has no fast way to verify the paper in front of them. The stakes are binary and irreversible: there is no "undo" for either decision.

**"Why would you bother?" (Pattern A):** Family disputes drive directive fraud. An estranged sibling presents an old directive naming themselves as agent, hiding the current one that names someone else. A family member who disagrees with the patient's wishes produces a "revised" directive with different instructions. These are not hypothetical — probate courts see these cases routinely. The question is whether the ER doctor, under time pressure, can distinguish the real directive from the fraudulent one.

## Data Verified

Patient name, date of birth, designated healthcare agent (proxy) and alternates, specific life-sustaining treatment wishes (DNR/DNI), organ donation preference, notary/witness attestation, date of execution.

**Document Types:**
- **Living Will:** Instructions for end-of-life care.
- **Medical Power of Attorney:** Appointing a decision-maker.
- **POLST/MOLST:** Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (bright pink/green forms).
- **DNR Order:** Do Not Resuscitate.

**Privacy Note:** While the directive contains sensitive data, the *hash* reveals nothing until the document is presented. A "Privacy Salt" line should be added to prevent enumeration attacks (guessing patient names).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., `uslivingwillregistry.com` or a hospital system) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — This is the latest known directive.
- **Revoked** — The patient cancelled this directive (e.g., made a new one).
- **Superseded** — A newer directive exists (date provided).

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient** benefits from verification.

**Emergency Access:** Carrying a wallet card with the verification URL/hash allows ER doctors to instantly verify and retrieve the directive details, even if the patient is unconscious and the paper document is at home.

**Family Clarity:** Resolving disputes between family members about "what Mom wanted." A verified document provides definitive proof of her wishes.

**Portability:** Ensuring wishes are honored even if the patient falls ill while traveling in another state (portability of directives).

## Third-Party Use

**Emergency Room Doctors**
**Immediate Decisions:** In critical moments (stroke/trauma), doctors hesitate to withhold care based on a crumpled photocopy or a family member's word. A verified "Active" status gives them the legal confidence to honor a DNR/DNI order immediately.

**Hospitals and Surgery Centers**
**Admission Compliance:** Hospitals must ask about advance directives (Patient Self-Determination Act). Verification simplifies this workflow.

**Estate Attorneys**
**Drafting Integrity:** Ensuring the directive they drafted is the one being used, and that no "home-made" modifications were added later.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Lost Directive" Problem**

- **Inaccessibility:** The Directive is in a safety deposit box when the patient is in the ER at 2 AM.
- **Outdated Versions:** A family member presents an old directive appointing themselves as agent, hiding the new one that appointed the estranged sibling.
- **Interoperability:** The directive is in the Kaiser Permanente system, but the patient is in a Banner Health ER. The systems don't talk.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Registries:** (e.g., U.S. Living Will Registry)
**Healthcare Systems:** (Epic MyChart, etc.)
**Secretary of State Offices:** (Some states maintain directive registries)

## Authority Chain
    
**Pattern:** Regulated

Solicitors draft and certify healthcare directives under mental capacity law.

```
✓ solicitors.example-firm.co.uk/ahd/verify — Drafts and certifies healthcare decisions
  ✓ sra.org.uk/solicitors — Regulates solicitors in England and Wales
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.


## Competition vs. HIEs and EHRs

| Feature | Live Verify | Health Info Exchange (HIE) | Wallet Card / USB |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works on any device with a browser. No integration needed. | **Limited.** Requires hospitals to be on the same network (e.g., Epic to Epic). Often fails across state lines. | **Medium.** USBs may be blocked by hospital security; physical cards can be lost. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan and view. | **Variable.** Can take time to query external records; may require patient consent (impossible if unconscious). | **Fast.** But relies on physical possession. |
| **Authority** | **High.** Shows issuer domain (Registry/Notary). | **High.** Trusted clinical data. | **Low.** Could be an old/fake card. |
| **Revocation** | **Real-time.** Status changes to REVOKED instantly. | **Good.** Updates eventually propagate. | **None.** Physical card still looks valid after revocation. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Last Mile" problem in healthcare. Even with billion-dollar EHRs, doctors often rely on paper delivered by family. Live Verify bridges the gap: it turns that paper (or a wallet card) into a real-time link to the source of truth, bypassing the complex and often broken HIE networks.
