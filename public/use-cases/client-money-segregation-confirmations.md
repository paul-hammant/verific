## What is a Client Money Segregation Confirmation?

In the investment and brokerage industry, **Client Money Segregation** (e.g., CASS in the UK) is the legal requirement that a firm must keep its customers' cash in separate bank accounts from the firm's own operating funds. This ensures that if the firm goes bankrupt (like Lehman Brothers or MF Global), the clients' money is "Ring-Fenced" and cannot be seized by the firm's creditors.

These documents are the "Safety Certificates" for an investor's cash. Fraud is high-stakes: a struggling firm might "edit" a segregation report to hide a shortfall or to cover up the illegal "commingling" of funds to pay for firm expenses. Verified hashes bind the **Audit Date, Shortfall Status, and Auditor's Name** to the firm's or the auditor's domain (e.g., `hl.co.uk` or `pwc.com`).

## Data Verified

Firm name, regulatory ID (FRN), confirmation date, segregation status (Pass/Fail), account designation type, reconciliation frequency, shortfall amount (if any), CASS oversight officer name, external auditor name/ID, date of last CASS audit report.

**Document Types:**
- **Monthly Segregation Attestation:** The primary proof for clients.
- **CASS Audit Opinion:** The formal year-end independent review.
- **Acknowledgement Letter:** (Linked hash) from the bank holding the client funds.
- **Breach Notification:** Proof that a previous shortfall was corrected.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`hl.co.uk`, `fidelity.com`, `barclays.co.uk`) and the safety standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Compliant** — The firm is currently meeting all segregation rules.
- **Shortfall Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The firm has reported a deficiency in client funds.
- **Audit Overdue** — **ALERT:** The mandatory annual CASS audit has not been completed.
- **Superseded** — A newer quarterly attestation is available.

## Second-Party Use

The **Retail / Institutional Client** benefits from verification.

**Investor Confidence:** Before depositing $1M into a new brokerage account, an institutional investor scans the firm's verified "Segregation Hash." "Verified by Sterling" ensures the investor that their cash is legally ring-fenced, removing the "Lehman Risk" and allowing the account opening to proceed.

**Annual Portfolio Review:** An individual investor can maintain a verified digital library of their firm's monthly attestations. During a personal financial audit, they can prove that their cash assets were held in a compliant, low-risk environment.

## Third-Party Use

**Insolvency Practitioners (Liquidators)**
**Asset Reconciliation:** In the event of a firm failure, the liquidator scans the verified hashes of the last 12 months of segregation reports. This provides the "Digital Map" needed to quickly return cash to clients, potentially saving years of legal gridlock.

**National Regulators (FCA / SEC)**
**Prudential Oversight:** Instead of manually reviewing 500 firms, the regulator can use an API to bulk-scan verified hashes. Any firm whose hash returns **"SHORTFALL ALERT"** is instantly flagged for an immediate on-site inspection.

**Trustees and Fiduciaries**
**Fiduciary Duty Proof:** Verifying that the investment platforms they use for their clients are maintaining the highest standards of fund segregation.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Commingling" Fraud Problem**

- **Shortfall Hiding:** Manually editing a "$10M shortfall" into "Zero" on a PDF report before sending it to a large client.
- **Account Mis-labeling:** Presenting a standard corporate account as a "Designated Client Account" to bypass audit controls.
- **Date Back-dating:** Creating a "Clean" report for a day when the firm actually illegally used client cash to cover a margin call.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Custodian Banks.**
**Retail Stockbrokers.**
**Financial Audit Firms (CASS Units).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Individual account volumes are sensitive business intelligence. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized clients and regulators.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Solicitors confirm client money segregation compliance with regulatory requirements.

```
✓ clientmoney.example-solicitors.co.uk/verify — Confirms client funds segregation compliance
  ✓ sra.org.uk/solicitors — Regulates solicitors in England and Wales
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Client money is the "Trust Core" of the financial system. By turning technical attestations into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the public from the devastating cost of firm failure and ensure that "Segregated" means "Safe."

## Jurisdictional Equivalents

| | UK | US | EU |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Authority** | FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) | SEC / CFTC | National competent authority (e.g., BaFin, AMF, CONSOB) |
| **Document** | CASS 7 segregation attestation / audit opinion | Customer Protection Rule confirmation (SEC Rule 15c3-3); CFTC Reg 1.20-1.30 statements | MiFID II client asset safeguarding report (varies by member state) |
| **Legal basis** | FCA Client Assets Sourcebook (CASS 7) | Securities Exchange Act 1934 (Rule 15c3-3); Commodity Exchange Act | MiFID II (Directive 2014/65/EU), delegated regulation on safeguarding |
| **Potential verify: domain** | `cass.fca.org.uk/v` | `sec.gov/custody/v` | `bafin.de/client-assets/v` (varies by state) |
| **Key difference** | Single rulebook (CASS) with daily reconciliation and annual external audit | SEC and CFTC have separate regimes for securities and futures; no unified "CASS-style" sourcebook | Harmonised at directive level but implementation and audit frequency vary by national regulator |

**Further Jurisdictional Peers**

- **Australia:** ASIC client money rules under Corporations Act 2001 s.981A-981H
- **Canada:** IIROC/CIPF client asset protection rules
- **Singapore:** SFA (Securities and Futures Act) — MAS regulations on client money
- **Japan:** FIEA (Financial Instruments and Exchange Act) client asset segregation
- **Switzerland:** FINMA rules on segregation of client assets under Banking Act
- **Hong Kong:** SFC Client Securities Rules and Client Money Rules

**Market Abuse & Insider Trading**

Falsifying client money segregation reports is a form of securities fraud — it misleads clients about the safety of their assets. MF Global (2011) and Lehman Brothers (2008) demonstrated how segregation failures can constitute market manipulation when combined with misleading statements to investors.

- **UK:** FCA CASS enforcement sits alongside market abuse powers; firms that misrepresent segregation status face both CASS sanctions and potential market abuse charges under UK MAR; FCA fined Barclays £38M (2015) for failure to segregate client money
- **US:** SEC Rule 15c3-3 (Customer Protection Rule) violations can be prosecuted as securities fraud under Securities Exchange Act s.10(b); SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation) provides investor compensation when segregation fails; MF Global's Jon Corzine faced SEC enforcement for segregation failures
- **EU:** MiFID II Art. 16(8)-(10) client asset obligations; national regulators enforce; ESMA has issued guidelines on asset segregation as an investor protection measure
- **Australia:** ASIC enforces client money obligations under Corporations Act s.981A-981H; BBY Group collapse (2015) highlighted segregation failures in Australian broking
- **Japan:** FIEA requires strict segregation via trust banks; Japan Securities Finance Co. provides additional protection layer; SESC monitors compliance
- **Singapore:** SFA client money rules enforced by MAS; segregation failures can trigger MAS enforcement action and market misconduct proceedings
- **Hong Kong:** SFC Client Securities Rules / Client Money Rules; SFC has taken enforcement action for segregation failures linked to market misconduct

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the firm's or auditor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (firm name, FCA FRN, attestation date, segregation status, shortfall amount if any, auditor name) — never individual account details or client names — providing non-repudiation of the segregation attestation and compliance standing.
