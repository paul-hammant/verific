## What is a Contractor COI?

If you hire a plumber to fix a leak or a massive construction crew to build a skyscraper, you need to see their **Certificate of Insurance (COI)**.

This one-page paper (usually an ACORD 25 form) is the "Proof of Protection." It says: "If this contractor breaks your house or if a worker gets hurt, the insurance company will pay, not you."

COI fraud is rampant. Contractors often buy a policy for one day, print the COI, and then cancel the policy immediately. They show the "valid" paper to get hired, but they are actually uninsured. Live Verify provides a "Live Status" check to see if the policy was cancelled yesterday.

## Data Verified

Insured name, policy numbers (GL, Auto, Umbrella, WC), coverage limits, effective/expiration dates, certificate holder name, producer/broker ID, issuing carrier (NAIC code).

**Document Types:**
- **ACORD 25:** Certificate of Liability Insurance (Standard).
- **ACORD 28:** Evidence of Commercial Property Insurance.
- **Waiver of Subrogation:** Critical construction endorsement.
- **Additional Insured Endorsement:** Adding the property owner to the policy.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Broker or Carrier) and the certificate standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Policies are in force and match the broker's system.
- **Cancelled** — One or more policies have been terminated.
- **Superseded** — An updated certificate has been issued (e.g., due to a limit change).
- **Expired** — The policies listed have reached their term end.

## Second-Party Use

The **Contractor** (second party) receives the certificate of insurance from the broker or carrier (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the insurance coverage. Most of the time, the document sits in their business files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the certificate matches what the broker's system recorded and the policies haven't been cancelled.

**Future Optionality:** If a project requires proof of insurance—whether for site access, bid submissions, or permit applications—they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the broker.

## Third-Party Use

The contractor (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Project Owners / Developers**
**Liability Protection:** Ensuring that every contractor on a $100M project is fully insured. Verification prevents the common fraud where a contractor provides a COI, gets the contract, and then cancels the policy to save money.

**Compliance Platforms (Procore / Complia)**
**Automated Vetting:** These platforms can use the verification hash to instantly validate thousands of COIs, reducing the need for manual "Broker Verification Calls."

**Insurance Brokers**
**Workflow Efficiency:** Reducing the volume of "Is this COI real?" phone calls from third parties by providing a self-service verification URL.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake COI" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Policies:** A contractor buys a policy for 1 day, prints the COI, then cancels the policy for a full refund. They carry the paper COI for 12 months.
- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $1M policy PDF to read $10M to qualify for a larger project.
- **Date Stretching:** Changing an expired 2025 date to 2026.
- **Fabricated Endorsements:** Claiming "Additional Insured" status on the paper COI when the endorsement was never actually purchased.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Insurance Brokers (Marsh, Aon, local agencies)
- Direct Carriers (Geico, Progressive, State Farm)
- Compliance Tech (Certificate management vendors)

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Certificates of insurance contain many unpredictable variables: contractor company names, unique policy numbers (often alphanumeric), specific coverage limits (exact dollar amounts), effective/expiration dates, certificate holder names, producer names and locations, and multiple policy types. The combination of these certificate-specific details creates sufficient entropy to prevent hash enumeration attacks.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Zurich issues certificates of insurance for contractors and construction operations.

```
✓ coi.zurich.co.uk/verify — Issues certificates of insurance for contractors
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the broker's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy numbers, coverage limits, effective dates, carrier names) — never contractor financial details or risk assessments — providing non-repudiation of the certificate it issued.

## Competition vs. Central Databases (ACORD)

| Feature | Live Verify | ACORD Data Pool | Paper COI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any site foreman/owner can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires expensive industry membership. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Broker/Insurer. | **Centralized.** Trust the ACORD database. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Limits* match. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the actual paper document. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Queries the broker's live file. | **Laggy.** Depends on batch uploads. | **Static.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Handoff Gap." ACORD data pools are for insurance companies talking to each other. But in the real world, a property owner needs to trust the piece of paper they are holding from a contractor. Live Verify turns that paper into a **Live Link** to the source of truth, closing the gap between industry databases and the physical world.
