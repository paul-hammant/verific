## Data Verified

Lender name, borrower name, loan ID, original loan amount, Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, insurance coverage percentage (e.g., 25-30%), monthly premium amount, effective date, issuing carrier (e.g., Arch, MGIC, Radian), master policy reference.

**Document Types:**
- **PMI Certificate:** The primary proof of "Mortgage Guarantee."
- **Evidence of LMI:** For international markets (e.g., Genworth in Australia).
- **Premium Notice:** For the borrower's annual escrow analysis.
- **Cancellation Notice:** Proving the loan has reached 78-80% LTV and PMI is removed.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`archmi.com`, `mgic.com`, `radian.com`) and current coverage standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; lender is verified protected against default.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Policy terminated (often due to payoff or 80% LTV reached).
- **Lapsed** — Payment missing; coverage at risk.
- **Claim Active** — Foreclosure occurred; claim in processing.

## Second-Party Use

The **Mortgage Lender (Insured)** benefits from verification.

**Secondary Market Sales:** Proving to a buyer of the mortgage (e.g., Fannie Mae or a private REIT) that the loan is "Verified Insured" by a top-tier PMI carrier. Loans with verified LMI sell for a higher premium because the "Default Risk" is cryptographically confirmed as mitigated.

**Internal Audit:** Ensuring that the "PMI Certificates" in thousands of loan files match the insurer's records, catching "Uninsured High-LTV" loans before they become a regulatory liability.

## Third-Party Use

**Government Sponsored Enterprises (Fannie/Freddie)**
**Quality Control:** Automatically verifying the LMI status of thousands of loans being delivered for securitization. Live Verify allows the GSEs to skip the manual "Evidence Review" for every single loan file.

**Mortgage Servicers**
**Escrow Reconciliation:** Verifying the "Monthly Premium" amount before paying the insurer, ensuring the borrower isn't being over-charged.

**Borrowers (Homeowners)**
**Termination Monitoring:** Proving to the lender that the home's value has increased enough to hit the 80% LTV threshold, requiring the "Verified Cancellation" of the PMI expense.

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-LTV" Fraud Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** A dishonest loan officer creating a fake "PMI Certificate" to trick a lender into funding a 97% LTV loan that the insurer actually rejected.
- **Limit Padding:** Editing a PDF to show "30% Coverage" when the insurer only authorized "12% Coverage" to meet secondary market rules.
- **Cancellation Concealment:** Hiding the fact that the PMI was cancelled due to a borrower's missed payments.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Private Mortgage Insurers:** (Arch, MGIC, Radian, Essent, Enact).
**FHA / VA Government Agencies:** (Hosting hashes for federal guarantees).
**National LMI Bureaus:** (In international markets like Australia/UK).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Genworth, a regulated mortgage insurance provider, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified lenders mortgage insurance certificates.

```
✓ lmi.genworth.co.uk/verify — Issues verified mortgage indemnity insurance certificates
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurance carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the mortgage indemnity insurance certificate.

## Competition vs. MERS / Industry Databases

| Feature | Live Verify | MERS / Industry Portal | Scanned PDF Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Insurer. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any buyer or auditor can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires paid membership. | **Instant.** |
| **Timeliness** | **Real-time.** Shows if premium paid *today*. | **Laggy.** Updates take weeks. | **Static.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *LTV Ratio*. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Loan File" reality. Mortgages are traded as "Static Files" (PDFs). Investors and GSEs audit the *content of the file*, not just a line in a database. Live Verify turn the **Static PMI Certificate** into a live, high-authority digital anchor, ensuring the "Credit Safety Net" is as strong as it looks on paper.
