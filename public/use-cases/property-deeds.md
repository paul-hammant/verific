## What is a Property Title Deed?

A **title deed** is the legal instrument that transfers ownership of real property from one owner to another. It is the recorded step in the chain of title for a piece of land.

In most jurisdictions, a deed is not fully effective against third parties until it is **Recorded** in the county's official land records.

## What property registries actually need to do

The key services a property registry provides are:

1. **Transactional verification** — parties about to commit money can confirm current ownership and encumbrances
2. **Recovery and reconstitution** — the registry is the backup when private deeds are lost or destroyed
3. **Priority resolution** — when competing claims exist, the registry determines who wins (first to record in good faith)
4. **Lien enforcement** — creditors, tax authorities, and courts can attach claims to property and have them respected by future buyers
5. **Boundary and parcel integrity** — the cadastral record defines what "Lot 42, Block 7" actually means physically

And arguably:

6. **Compulsory purchase / eminent domain** — the state needs to know who to compensate
7. **Tax assessment** — the municipality needs to know who owes property tax on what
8. **Fraud prevention** — the registry should make it difficult to record forged deeds, fabricate transfers, or extract loans against properties the borrower does not control. Title theft is almost always reversed eventually, but the damage is real: the legitimate owner faces months of legal costs, frozen equity, and disrupted sales while the fraud is unwound.

Every one of these works with **authenticated access by parties with a legitimate interest.** None requires the records to be browsable by the general public as an open dataset.

In the US, most county recorder offices make deed records fully public — searchable online, often with bulk download. That is an implementation choice inherited from the paper-courthouse era, not a legal necessity. It was the cheapest model when restricting access would have meant hiring someone to check credentials at the counter. That accident of convenience now supports a multi-billion-dollar data economy (CoreLogic, ATTOM, title insurance, Zillow, etc.) and has powerful constituencies defending it as though publicity were the point. But the *services* are the point.

## Title Theft

Title theft is a real and growing fraud pattern:

1. Criminal forges a quitclaim deed with the homeowner's name (or registry reference) as grantor
2. Gets it notarized (fake notary, corrupt notary, or identity theft)
3. Records it at the county — many counties have minimal verification at the counter
4. Uses the recorded deed to take out a home equity loan or sell the property
5. Homeowner often doesn't discover it for months

### How Live Verify addresses each step

**Step 1 — Forging the deed:** With hashed party references, the criminal cannot simply write "MARIA G. RODRIGUEZ" on the deed. They would need the victim's registry reference hash. However, if earlier deeds are on public record, the hash may be obtainable from them. Hashed references raise the bar but do not eliminate this step.

**Step 2 — Notarization:** Live Verify does not fix corrupt or fake notaries. If the notary is complicit or deceived, the deed gets notarized regardless. This remains a weak point in the system.

**Step 3 — Recording:** This is where Live Verify has the strongest effect. If the county recorder publishes verification hashes only after validating the incoming deed against the existing chain — confirming that the grantor's registry reference matches the current registered owner — then a fraudulent deed is never hashed. It may still be physically filed (counties are often required to accept documents presented for recording), but it receives no verification hash. Any subsequent check returns 404.

**Step 4 — Using the deed:** The lender or buyer verifies the deed before committing money. No hash → 404 → the deed does not verify. The lender refuses the loan. The buyer walks away. The fraud collapses at the point where the criminal tries to extract value.

**Step 5 — Discovery delay:** If the county offers a "watch" service (notify the registered owner when any new instrument is recorded against their parcel), the homeowner learns about the fraudulent filing quickly rather than months later. The watch service is complementary infrastructure, not part of Live Verify itself, but verification hashes make it more useful — the owner can immediately check whether the new instrument verifies.

### Strengthening step 2: the notary as a verifiable link

The notarial attestation is itself a verifiable claim (see [Notary Documents](view.html?doc=notary-documents)). If the notary's act is hashed and published to the notary's commissioning authority — say, `verify:flsos.gov/notary/v` — then the county recorder can require a verified notarial attestation before publishing the deed hash.

That turns the chain into:

1. Notary verifies the person's identity against the county's registry reference
2. Notary issues a verifiable attestation: "I confirm the person behind `a]7f3b2e...` appeared and signed instrument 20260316000442"
3. The notarial attestation is hashed and published to the notary's commissioning authority
4. The county recorder checks: does this deed have a verified notarial attestation? If not, no deed hash is published.

With this chain in place:

- **Fake notary stamps** are caught — the stamp claims a commission number, but the commission doesn't verify at the Secretary of State's endpoint
- **Corrupt notaries** create a stronger evidence trail — the notary's own verifiable attestation is on record and auditable. It doesn't prevent the corruption, but it makes it traceable and prosecutable.
- **Stolen or expired commissions** are caught — the commissioning authority returns COMMISSION_REVOKED or COMMISSION_EXPIRED

This does not eliminate the corrupt-notary problem entirely. A genuinely corrupt notary with a valid commission who knowingly attests a false identity will still produce a verifiable attestation. But the attestation is now a permanent, auditable, non-repudiable record of who claimed to witness whom — which makes investigation and prosecution far easier.

### What Live Verify does NOT solve

- A corrupt notary with a valid commission who knowingly attests a false identity (though the attestation creates an auditable evidence trail)
- A county recorder who does not validate the chain before publishing a hash
- Jurisdictions that accept and record any document presented, with no chain validation at intake
- Social engineering attacks where the criminal impersonates the owner convincingly enough to pass both the notary's identity check and the registry reference verification

The strongest configuration requires the county to treat hash publication as a validation step (not merely an index of everything filed), and to require a verified notarial attestation as a prerequisite. That is an operational change at the county level, not just a technology deployment.

## Hashed Party References

A deed must identify its parties — but it does not need to broadcast their names on the public face of the instrument. The deed can reference each party by a **registry reference**: a truncated hash derived from an identity record held separately by the county.

The county holds the identity record:

```
MARIA G. RODRIGUEZ
SSN last four: 4418
DOB: 1971-03-12
Salt: 2a76be121b22a52
```

That record hashes to `a]7f3b2e...`, which appears on the face of the deed instead of the plaintext name.

**How each registry service still works:**

- **Notarization:** The notary still sees Maria G. Rodriguez in person with her ID. She signs, the notary attests, and the notarial record confirms she is the person behind `a]7f3b2e...`. The notarial function is preserved — it is just the public-facing artifact that carries the hash, not the name.
- **Title search:** The county provides hash-based search to authorised parties (title companies, lenders, attorneys). The county already holds the name-to-reference mapping internally.
- **Legal proceedings:** The jurisdiction discloses the plaintext identity record under subpoena, court order, or other legal process. The hash is an indirection layer, not an anonymisation layer.
- **Cross-county liens:** A judgment in County B against "MARIA G. RODRIGUEZ" is linked to County A's hash via the identity resolution layer when the lien is filed. This requires systems plumbing across counties, not a conceptual change.

**What this prevents:**

- Casual name-search scraping by data brokers
- Bulk download of owner identities
- Stalking and doxxing via public property records
- The current workaround of shell companies and trusts, which obscure ownership from *everyone* including legitimate parties

**This requires recording-rule changes.** Most US states currently require deeds to identify parties by name on the face of the recorded instrument. Adopting hashed references would need statutory or recording-rule amendments to allow "identified by registry reference" as a valid form of party identification. This is a legal-design change, not a drop-in operational change.

That said, the concept is not radical. It is how the financial system already works — your bank account number is not your name, your SWIFT transfer identifies you by reference, and the bank discloses the mapping under legal process. Property recording is simply behind on this because the paper-courthouse model never needed the indirection.

## Data Verified

Title or parcel reference, full legal description (Metes and Bounds or Lot/Block), tax parcel ID (APN), prior instrument reference, current instrument number, recording timestamp, transfer type, chain position, and optionally sale-history summary.

**Party identification:** The deed references parties by hashed registry reference (see "Hashed Party References" above) rather than plaintext names. The registry holds the identity records and discloses them to authorised parties and under legal process. The public-facing verification surface carries property-centric identifiers and chain-of-title continuity, not owner identity.

**Document Types:**
- **Warranty Deed:** Highest protection; grantor warrants clear title and will defend against all claims.
- **Special / Limited Warranty Deed:** Grantor only warrants against defects during their own ownership period, not the full chain history.
- **Quitclaim Deed:** Grantor transfers whatever interest they have, with zero warranties. The fraud weapon of choice because it is fast, cheap, and many counties do not scrutinize them.
- **Trustee's / Executor's Deed:** Transfers from trusts, estates, or foreclosures.
- **Correction Deed:** Issued to fix errors in previous filings.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the County Recorder or Registrar) and the current title-chain status.

**Important:** this page should model the **title / chain-of-history layer**, not every possible property state. Occupancy, listing status, vacancy, physical destruction, and similar matters are better handled by a separate multidimensional property-state record.

**Status Indications:**
- **Recorded** — Document is authentic and part of the official chain of title.
- **Verified-But-Superseded** — Document was authentic when recorded, but later recorded transfers mean it is now historical only. A privacy-preserving response may state that later transfers exist and how many, without disclosing current owner identity or successor instrument details.
- **Voided/Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** County has flagged this instrument as fraudulent or revoked by court order.
- **Amended** — Superseded by a "Correction Deed" (linked hash).
- **Pending** — Received by the county but not yet fully indexed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner (Grantee)** benefits from verification.

**Equity Protection:** Proving to a lender or a buyer that the deed is the "Verified Last-in-Chain" instrument. This stops "Title Theft" before it can happen, as the owner can set a "Watch" on their own property hash.

**Estate Planning:** Ensuring that a deed transferring a home into a family trust is verified and recorded correctly, preventing probate delays.

## Third-Party Use

**Title Insurance Companies**
**Chain of Title Integrity:** During a home sale, the title officer scans every deed in the 30-year history. "Verified by County" ensures no "Wild Deeds" or fake instruments were inserted into the records to hide a lien or steal ownership.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Collateral Vetting:** Verifying that the property offered as collateral matches the current verified chain of title and last recorded transfer. This stops "Air Loan" fraud where scammers take out loans on properties they don't control.

**Real Estate Attorneys**
**Litigation Evidence:** In a "Quiet Title" action, providing the court with a cryptographically verified history of every transfer, making it impossible for opposing parties to present forged paper deeds.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dirty Paper" Fraud Problem**

- **Signature Forgery:** The #1 real estate fraud. Criminals forging transfer authority on a Quitclaim deed.
- **"Wild Deeds":** Recording a deed that looks real but has no connection to the previous owner in the chain.
- **Notary Fraud:** Using a stolen or fabricated notary seal to make a fake deed look "Official."

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**County Recorders / Registrars of Deeds:** (The primary source of truth).
**Title Insurance Underwriters:** (e.g., First American, Old Republic - who host "Verified Title" mirror hashes).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

HM Land Registry maintains the UK property register and issues property deed registrations under the Land Registration Act 2002.

```
✓ landregistry.gov.uk/verify — HM Land Registry property deed registration service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the county recorder's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (parcel number, deed date, grantor/grantee names, recording date, document type) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the recorded property transfer.


## Competition vs. Blockchain (NFTs)

| Feature | Live Verify | Blockchain (NFT) | Traditional Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal Standing** | **High.** Binds to existing laws. | **Low.** Courts don't yet recognize NFTs as deeds. | **Standard.** |
| **Accessibility** | **Universal.** Any smartphone. | **Technical.** Requires crypto-wallets. | **Visual.** |
| **Implementation** | **Cheap.** API over existing DB. | **Expensive.** Requires new legal framework. | **Manual.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **The County.** (Elected Official). | **The Network.** (Decentralized). | **The Paper.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Recorder's Counter" reality. Real estate law is 500 years old. It moves slowly. Live Verify provides **"Digital Integrity for Paper Reality"**—it gives the benefits of a blockchain (immutability and verification) without requiring the world to rewrite its property laws or abandon the physical deed. For ordinary homeowner privacy, a separate short-lived ownership-proof use case should sit on top of this permanent title layer rather than reusing the permanent deed artifact directly.
