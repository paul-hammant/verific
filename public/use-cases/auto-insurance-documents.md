## Scope

This file actually contains two different families:

- **claims and repair documents**, where portable estimates and claim summaries move between insurer, customer, body shop, lender, and buyer
- **auto insurance ID cards**, where the real source of truth is usually the insurer or DMV-linked coverage system

Those two families are not equally strong for Live Verify. Claims and repair documents are the stronger fit because they routinely travel outside the insurer's native system. The ID-card half is more complementary and often secondary to direct insurer/DMV checks.

## Data Verified

Insured name, vehicle VIN, Claim ID, repair estimate total, parts/labor breakdown, body shop name, adjuster name, date of estimate.

**Document Types:**
- **Initial Appraisal:** The first field estimate.
- **Supplement Request:** For hidden damage found after tear-down.
- **Final Proof of Loss:** The final document signed by the insured to release payment.
- **Total Loss Valuation:** (Market value vs. repair cost).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Insurance Carrier) and the claim status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Estimate matches the carrier's system; payment authorized.
- **Supplemented** — This estimate is outdated; a new Supplement #2 exists.
- **Paid** — Funds have been issued to the body shop/insured.
- **Closed** — Claim file completed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insured** (Vehicle Owner) benefits from verification.

**Body Shop Oversight:** Proving to the body shop exactly what the insurance company agreed to pay for (e.g., OEM parts vs. Aftermarket). Verification prevents "part-swapping" fraud where the shop charges for OEM but installs cheap knock-offs.

**Sale of Vehicle:** Providing a "Verified Clean" repair history to a future buyer, proving that the $6,800 repair was for cosmetic damage and not structural frame issues.

## Third-Party Use

**Body Shops**
**Payment Assurance:** Before starting work, the shop scans the estimate provided by the customer. "Verified by Allstate" gives them confidence that the estimate really came from the carrier and has not been padded or superseded in transit.

**Used Car Buyers (CARFAX)**
**History Integrity:** If a car is repaired but never reported to CARFAX, the damage history is hidden. A verified claim or repair estimate is a portable, source-bound record of what the insurer actually assessed and paid.

**Lienholders (Banks)**
**Collateral Protection:** Banks need to ensure that insurance payouts are actually used to fix the car (their collateral) and not just pocketed by the owner. Verifying the repair estimate and completion status protects the loan.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Padded Estimate" Fraud Problem**

- **PDF Alteration:** A shady body shop takes a $2,000 estimate from the insurer and edits the PDF to read $6,000 before showing it to the customer.
- **Prior Damage Fraud:** Claiming that old scratches from 2 years ago were part of yesterday's fender-bender.
- **Phantom Supplements:** Forging "Supplement #1" to get extra cash from the insurer for damage that doesn't exist.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Insurance Carriers:** (Allstate, Geico, State Farm, etc.)
**Adjusting Firms:** (Third-party firms like Crawford & Co).
**Body Shop Management Systems:** (CCC One, Mitchell, Audatex).

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the repair estimate.

## Competition vs. Central Databases (CARFAX)

| Feature | Live Verify | CARFAX / Autocheck | Paper Estimate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Granularity** | **High.** Shows line-item parts/labor. | **Low.** Often just says "Accident Reported - Damage to Front." | **High.** But untrusted. |
| **Speed** | **Real-time.** Available as soon as the adjuster hits "save." | **Laggy.** Can take weeks or months for claims to appear in CARFAX. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the Insurer's domain. | **Reporting-Based.** Relies on data feeds which can be incomplete. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |

**Practical conclusion for claims documents:** This is a strong Live Verify fit. The insurer remains the source of truth, but the estimate or claim summary is exactly the kind of human-readable artifact that gets emailed, printed, negotiated over, and later re-opened outside the carrier's native system.

## What is an Auto ID Card?

An **Auto Insurance ID Card** is the "Proof of Insurance" you keep in your glovebox or digital wallet. In almost every US state, driving without one is illegal and can lead to your car being impounded.

The card proves three things:
1.  **Who is insured:** The named driver.
2.  **What is insured:** The specific vehicle (VIN).
3.  **The Timeframe:** That the policy hasn't expired.

Because people often cancel their insurance right after printing the card, police and DMV agents need a way to verify that the policy is **live** and hasn't been terminated for non-payment.

But this is much closer to a direct insurer / DMV / central-database problem than to a portable-document-integrity problem. Where official coverage databases or insurer APIs exist, they should remain primary. Live Verify is more plausible as a convenience layer for lower-capability relying parties holding only the card.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">
  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="ins"></span>GEICO                                        AUTO INSURANCE ID CARD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Policy Number:    9988-77-66

Vehicle:          2025 Northbridge Motors Signature-Sedan
VIN:              1G6AX57L9RJ123456

Effective Date:   JAN 01, 2026

This card is for information only.
Refer to your policy for actual coverage.

<span data-verify-line="ins">verify:geico.com/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="ins"></span></pre>
</div>

## Data Verified

Insured name, policy number, NAIC code, VIN (Full), vehicle year/make/model, effective date, expiration date, issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Standard ID Card:** Paper or digital wallet.
- **Binder:** Temporary 30-day proof for new purchases.
- **SR-22 / FR-44:** High-risk financial responsibility filings.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`geico.com`, `statefarm.com`) and real-time coverage status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Policy is currently in force.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated (e.g., for non-payment) *even if the card isn't expired*.
- **Pending Renewal** — Policy about to expire but payment found.
- **Lapsed** — No coverage.

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder** benefits from verification.

**Roadside Verification:** When pulled over, showing a "Verified Active" status to a police officer prevents the car from being impounded if the officer suspects the paper card is fake.

**Registration / DMV:** Providing verified proof of insurance to the DMV during tag renewal, bypassing the need for manual database checks which often fail due to VIN typos.

## Third-Party Use

**Police Officers**
**Traffic Stops:** Official insurer or DMV-connected coverage systems should remain primary where available. Live Verify is more credible as a fallback when the officer or another relying party is forced to work from the visible card itself.

**Rental Car Agencies**
**Liability Transfer:** Verifying that the customer's personal policy actually covers rental cars (Collision Damage Waiver bypass).

**Car Dealerships**
**Off-Lot Authorization:** A dealer can use the card as a quick bridge to current insurer state before letting a buyer drive off the lot, but direct insurer confirmation remains the stronger architecture where available.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Policy" Fraud Problem**

- **Buy and Cancel:** The most common fraud. A driver buys a policy, prints the card, then cancels the policy for a full refund. They carry the "valid" paper card for 6 months to fool police.
- **VIN Tampering:** Changing the VIN on an old card to match a new, uninsured car.
- **Identity Swapping:** Editing the name on a friend's insurance card.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Insurance Carriers:** (Geico, Progressive, State Farm, etc.)
**State DMVs / Insurance Verification Networks:** (As oversight and status-distribution bodies).

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the ID card.

## Competition vs. DMV Databases (ALIR/IIVS)

| Feature | Live Verify | DMV Central DB (IIVS) | Paper Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Queries the insurer directly. | **Laggy.** Often 24-72 hours behind. | **Static.** |
| **Availability** | **Broad.** Useful outside restricted official channels. | **Variable.** Often restricted or state-bounded. | **Manual.** |
| **Accessibility** | **Open.** Dealers and rental agents can verify. | **Restricted.** Only police/DMV have access. | **Zero.** |

**Practical conclusion for ID cards:** the stronger answer is still direct insurer or DMV-linked status. Live Verify is most defensible when a relying party only has the visible card and lacks access to those native systems.

**Narrower conclusion for ID cards:** portability is the only strong part of this sub-case. Where official insurer or DMV-linked systems are available, they should remain primary. Live Verify is only the bridge when the visible card is all the relying party has.

## What is a Declarations Page?

An insurance policy can be 50 pages of legal jargon. The **Declarations Page** (or "Dec Page") is the one-page summary that actually matters. It lists:
1.  **Limits:** How much the company will pay (e.g., $100k/$300k).
2.  **Deductibles:** How much you pay out of pocket ($500).
3.  **Drivers:** Exactly who is covered.

Lenders (for car loans) and landlords often require a copy of the Dec Page. Fraudsters often "Photoshopping" these pages to show higher coverage limits than they actually have to win contracts or satisfy loan requirements.

</div>

## Data Verified

Named insured, policy limits, deductibles, VIN, effective dates, premium amount, lienholder name.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`progressive.com`) and the policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Policy is current.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated.
- **Pending** — Renewal in process.

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder** benefits from verification.
- **Loan Compliance:** Proving to a bank that they have the required "Full Coverage" for their car loan.
- **Job Requirements:** Gig workers (Uber/DoorDash) proving they have the correct insurance tier.

## Third-Party Use

**Lenders (Auto Finance)**
**Collateral Protection:** Banks can scan the Dec Page provided by the borrower to ensure the "Loss Payee" is correctly listed and the deductibles aren't too high.

**Attorneys (Personal Injury)**
**Demand Letters:** When an accident happens, lawyers need to know the *true* policy limits. Verification prevents "Ghost Limits" fraud where a driver claims to have $1M in coverage but only has the state minimum.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the declarations page.

## Competition vs. ACORD Certificates

| Feature | Live Verify | ACORD 25 (Standard) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to insurer. | **Visual.** Prone to easy editing. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan and verify. | **Slow.** Requires calling the broker. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** | **Binds Nothing.** Just a template. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:**
The Dec Page is the source of truth. ACORD forms are just summaries written by brokers. Live Verify allows the **Source Document** to be verified directly against the **Carrier**, cutting out the middleman and the potential for "Summary Errors."

## What is an Auto Transport Report?

When you ship a car across the country on a truck, the driver performs a "walk-around" inspection at your driveway. They mark every existing scratch or chip on a **Bill of Lading (BOL)** or inspection report.

This document is the only thing protecting you if the car arrives at the destination with a new dent.

Fraud is common: drivers sometimes "edit" the digital report *after* they damage the car, adding a scratch to the "Origin" report so it looks like it was already there. Verified snapshots prevent this "after-the-fact" tampering.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="damage"></span>RELIABLE CAR CARRIERS, INC.

<span data-verify-line="damage">verify:reliable-carriers.com/bol/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="damage"></span></pre>
</div>

## Data Verified

Carrier DOT/MC number, vehicle VIN, pickup/delivery locations, timestamps, detailed damage codes (scratches, dents, chips), driver name, customer signature.

**Document Types:**
- **Electronic Bill of Lading (eBOL):** The primary transport contract.
- **Delivery Receipt:** Final sign-off showing new damage.
- **Damage Claim Form:** Filed after delivery for hidden issues.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Auto Transport Carrier) and the report status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Origin Signed** — Pickup condition is locked.
- **Delivered** — Transport complete; final inspection filed.
- **Claim Active** — Customer has reported damage; under investigation.
- **Void** — Order cancelled or re-issued.

## Second-Party Use

The **Vehicle Owner** (or Dealer) benefits from verification.

**Insurance Claims:** Proving to their own insurance company that the "dent in the hood" was NOT present at pickup in LA, but IS present on the Miami delivery receipt. A verified origin report prevents the carrier from claiming "it was like that when we got it."

**Remote Purchase:** A buyer in Miami buying a car from a dealer in LA can verify the driver's pickup report to ensure the dealer didn't ship a damaged car.

## Third-Party Use

**Cargo Insurers**
**Liability Allocation:** When a $200,000 car arrives damaged, the insurer needs to know exactly when the damage occurred. Verification prevents the carrier from "editing" the pickup report after the damage happens to make it look like pre-existing condition.

**Used Car Dealers**
**Inventory Audit:** Verifying that incoming shipments match the condition reports from the transport company, ensuring no hidden transport damage is passed on to the retail customer.

**Fleet Managers**
**Driver Oversight:** Ensuring drivers are performing honest inspections and not skipping steps or fabricating "clean" reports to speed up their route.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Pre-Existing" Damage Fraud Problem**

- **Report Editing:** Drivers taking a clean car, scratching it, and then editing the "Origin" PDF to add a "Scratch" notation to avoid a claim.
- **Signature Forgery:** Using a digital image of a customer's signature from a previous move on a new, damaged shipment.
- **Photo Tampering:** Replacing inspection photos with older, cleaner photos of the same vehicle model.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Auto Transport Carriers:** (Reliable Carriers, Horseless Carriage).
**Broker Platforms:** (Central Dispatch, ShipCarsNow).
**Inspection Apps:** (SuperDispatch, Car-Arrive).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

```
✓ motor.directline.co.uk/verify — Underwrites UK motor insurance
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the transport report.

## Competition vs. Central Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | SuperDispatch / Carrier Portal | Paper Carbon Copy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field Access** | **Universal.** Scan the paper/tablet. | **Restricted.** Requires app login usually for drivers only. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the origin state. | **Database-Bound.** Relies on the portal not being "corrected" later. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Sharing** | **Easy.** Share the PDF/Link with any insurer. | **Hard.** Requires "Exporting" reports or giving portal access. | **Manual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Handoff Moment." Inspections happen in driveways and parking lots. The customer needs a trusted snapshot of the car's state *right now*. Live Verify turns that paper/digital sign-off into an immutable anchor that prevents "After-the-fact" editing of damage records.
