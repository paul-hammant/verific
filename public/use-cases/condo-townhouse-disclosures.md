## What is a Condo Disclosure?

When you buy a condominium, you aren't just buying a home; you are "marrying" a corporation (the HOA). You need to know if the building is healthy or if it's about to collapse financially.

The **Resale Certificate** or **Disclosure** is the paper that tells the truth:
1.  **The Dues:** Exactly how much you pay every month.
2.  **Special Assessments:** "Does every owner owe $20,000 for a new roof next month?"
3.  **The Rules:** "Are pets or Airbnbs allowed?"

Sellers often "Delete" the scary pages of these reports to trick buyers. Verified disclosures ensure the buyer is seeing the **unfiltered financial truth** from the property manager.

## Data Verified

HOA name, property unit address, current monthly dues, special assessment amounts/dates, reserve fund balance, violation status, rental restrictions (if any), management firm ID, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Resale Certificate:** Mandatory for most US condo sales.
- **Estoppel Letter:** Confirming the seller's debt status to the HOA.
- **Budget Disclosure:** Proving the financial health of the building.
- **CC&R Extract:** Proving the latest version of the rules.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`premier-mgmt.com`, `associa.com`) and current unit standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Cleared** — All dues paid; no violations.
- **Arrears** — Seller owes money to the HOA (must be settled at closing).
- **Violation Active** — Unresolved architectural or noise citations.
- **Pending Assessment** — A new special assessment was just voted on.

## Second-Party Use

The **Seller** benefits from verification.

**Smooth Closing:** Proving to the buyer's title company that the $12,500 special assessment is the *only* outstanding debt. This prevents the title company from escrowing too much money or delaying the closing because of "vague" HOA paperwork.

**Marketing:** Showing a "Verified Violation-Free" status to potential buyers, making the unit more attractive than others with unverified histories.

## Third-Party Use

**Home Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** Scanning the disclosure provided by the seller. Verification ensures the seller didn't "Delete" the page showing a $50,000 pending roof assessment to trick the buyer into a bad deal.

**Mortgage Underwriters**
**Risk Assessment:** Lenders verify the "Reserve Fund" status. If the HOA is under-funded, the bank might refuse the mortgage. Verified disclosures reduce the underwriter's manual "HOA Questionnaire" workload.

**Title Companies**
**Lien Search:** Confirming the exact amount of dues owed to ensure the HOA lien is properly satisfied at the moment of transfer.

## Verification Architecture

**The "HOA Surprise" Fraud Problem**

- **Assessment Hiding:** Editing the PDF to change a $20,000 special assessment to $0.
- **Rental Restriction Erasure:** Deleting the page that says "No short-term rentals" to sell the unit to an unsuspecting Airbnb investor.
- **Fabricated Estoppels:** Creating a fake management letter to hide years of unpaid dues.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Property Management Firms:** (Associa, FirstService Residential).
**Self-Managed HOA Boards.**
**HOA Tech Platforms:** (e.g., HomeWiseDocs, CondoCerts).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

HOA disclosures are issued by property managers and regulated by the California real estate authority.

```
✓ disclosures.example-hoa.com/verify — Issues HOA resale certificates and financial disclosures
  ✓ dre.ca.gov — Regulates California real estate
    ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the HOA or management company's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the disclosure it issued.


## Competition vs. HOA Search Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | HomeWiseDocs / CondoCerts | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Mgmt firm. | **System-Bound.** Trust the vendor platform. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Cost** | **Free.** (Marginal hosting). | **Very High.** Disclosure packs cost $300-$600 each. | **None.** |
| **User Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper in the lobby. | **Slow.** Requires paying a fee and waiting 3-5 days. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Dues* match. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Cost and Immediacy. HOA disclosure portals are notoriously expensive and slow. Live Verify allows a buyer to verify the **authenticity of the specific document** they already received, without needing to pay a third-party platform another $400 for a fresh copy of the same data.
