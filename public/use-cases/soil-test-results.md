## What is a Soil Analysis Report?

In modern agriculture, the **Soil Analysis Report** is the "Blood Test" for a field. It measures critical chemical metrics—pH levels, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK), and Organic Carbon—that determine what crops can grow and how much fertilizer is needed.

These reports are high-value documents. Farmers use them to secure **Crop Loans**, land buyers use them to judge **Property Value**, and increasingly, companies use them to verify **Carbon Credits**. Fraud is common: people "edit" a poor soil report to hide contamination or to inflate organic carbon levels to fraudulently claim "Green Subsidies" or carbon payouts. Verified hashes bind the **Field ID, Lab Metrics, and Timestamp** to the testing lab's domain (e.g., `agrolabs.com` or `soil-science.edu`).

ANALYSIS REPORT                                  Batch #: QC-992288

Client:     GREEN ACRES FAMILY FARM       Sample Date:  MARCH 15, 2026
Field ID:   North-42 (APN: 998-776)       Lab Tech:     Dr. Sarah Jenkins
Crop Type:  Winter Wheat                  Method:       Mehlich-3 Extraction

TEST RESULTS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Test Component                           Result              Rating
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Soil pH                                     6.8             OPTIMAL
Organic Matter (%)                         4.2%                HIGH
Nitrogen (N) - ppm                           12           DEFICIENT

RECOMMENDATIONS: Apply 80 lbs/acre Urea (46-0-0). Monitor pH
levels post-harvest. No lime required.

## Data Verified

Field ID (APN/Parcel), client name, lab name, sample date, chemical metrics (pH, N, P, K, Carbon), organic matter percentage, lab tech ID, analysis method, recommendation summary.

**Document Types:**
- **Soil Analysis Report:** The primary nutrient map.
- **Water Quality Test:** Checking for heavy metals or toxins.
- **Carbon Sequestration Certificate:** Proof of carbon stored in soil.
- **Pesticide Residue Analysis:** Proving "Organic" compliance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`agrolabs.com`, `state-university.edu`, `eurofins.com`) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Passed** — Data matches the lab's original testing snapshot.
- **Contaminated Alert** — **CRITICAL:** High levels of heavy metals or toxins detected.
- **Superseded** — A newer test for this parcel exists (soil changes every season).
- **Invalid** — **ALERT:** The report has been disavowed by the lab (e.g., due to sample tampering).

## Second-Party Use

The **Farmer / Landowner** benefits from verification.

**Crop Financing:** Before releasing a $500,000 seasonal credit line, the bank scans the farmer's soil report. "Verified by Agro-Metrics" ensures the land is actually fertile and the crop plan is viable, reducing the bank's risk and speeding up the loan.

**Organic Certification:** An organic farmer can provide verified "Pesticide-Free" soil reports to regulators or premium buyers (e.g., Whole Foods) to prove their soil meets high-value certification standards without needing manual audits.

## Third-Party Use

**Real Estate Appraisers / Buyers**
**Valuation Integrity:** A buyer looking at a $10M farm scans the verified soil reports. Live Verify ensures the seller isn't hiding a "pH imbalance" or "Nitrogen depletion" that would cost thousands to fix.

**Carbon Credit Registries**
**Greenwashing Prevention:** Companies buying carbon credits (to offset emissions) scan the verified organic matter reports. Verification ensures the farmer actually increased soil carbon and isn't "Fabricating" environmental progress.

**Environmental Regulators**
**Nutrient Management Audit:** Verifying that a large-scale livestock operation is correctly reporting its soil Nitrogen levels to prevent manure run-off into local rivers.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dirt Fraud" Problem**

- **Metric Padding:** Editing a "3% Organic Matter" report to show "5%" to qualify for a carbon credit payout.
- **Contamination Hiding:** Removing a line showing "High Lead Content" before selling a residential development site.
- **Parcel Swapping:** Using a report from a fertile 40-acre field to cover for a rocky, infertile field nearby.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Commercial Agricultural Labs.**
**University Soil Testing Extensions.**
**Government Environmental Agencies.**

**Privacy Salt:** Medium. Field coordinates and farmer identities are private business data. The hash must be salted to prevent "Yield Mapping" by competitors.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Agricultural testing labs analyze soil composition and issue reports for nutrient management.

```
✓ soil.example-lab.co.uk — Tests soil nutrient levels and environmental properties
  ✓ ukas.com — Accredits UK testing laboratories
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Soil is the "Foundation of the Food Supply." By turning soil reports into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that the environmental and economic data we rely on is based on real science, not creative editing.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the testing lab's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (field ID, sample date, chemical metrics, lab tech ID, analysis method) — never plaintext or sensitive business information — providing non-repudiation of the soil test results.
