## Data Verified

Licensee name, photo (hash), license number (MA), business establishment ID (if applicable), board certification status (e.g., NCBTMB), background check clearance date, disciplinary history status, expiration date, issuing state board.

**Document Types:**
- **Practitioner License:** Posted at the individual's treatment room.
- **Establishment License:** For the massage clinic or spa.
- **CEU Certificate:** Proving current educational units for renewal.
- **Insurance Certificate:** (Linked hash) for professional liability.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`flhealthsource.gov`, `camtc.org`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — License is valid and in good standing.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Access revoked due to safety or legal violation.
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from practicing (e.g., sexual misconduct).
- **Expired** — Renewal or updated background check required.

## Second-Party Use

The **Massage Therapist (Practitioner)** benefits from verification.

**Protects both sides.** This is one of the few professions where verification genuinely protects both parties equally. The client needs to know the therapist has passed background checks before entering a private room. The therapist — particularly mobile therapists who visit clients' homes — needs a credible, state-backed credential to establish their professionalism immediately. The licensed therapist benefits because every unlicensed operator who cannot be distinguished from a professional drags the entire industry's trust downward.

**Employment Portability:** Proving to a new spa manager or luxury hotel that their "Active License" claim is verified by the state. This separates the professional from "Unlicensed Operators" who try to work in the industry without a background check.

**Personal Safety:** For mobile therapists entering private homes, having a verified, state-backed ID badge provides an extra layer of professional authority and safety.

## Third-Party Use

**Spa Customers / Clients**
**Assault Prevention:** Before entering a private room for a treatment, a customer can scan the therapist's badge. "Verified by State Board" ensures the person has passed the mandatory criminal and sex-offender background checks, reducing the risk of misconduct.

**Law Enforcement / Human Trafficking Units**
**Field Enforcement:** Officers inspecting massage establishments can instantly verify the credentials of all staff. Live Verify allows for the rapid identification of illicit operations or "Phantom Licenses" used to hide human trafficking.

**Insurance Companies**
**Malpractice Vetting:** Verifying that a therapist has an active, non-disciplined license before issuing or renewing professional liability coverage.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom License" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Unlicensed individuals using a real therapist's name and license number to find work at un-vetted clinics.
- **Disciplinary Hiding:** A practitioner who was banned for misconduct in one state moving to another state and using an old, valid-looking paper license to get a job.
- **Template Forgery:** Scammers selling fake board certificates online to illicit massage parlor operators.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Boards of Massage Therapy:** (e.g., Florida Board, Texas TDLR).
**Voluntary Certification Boards:** (e.g., NCBTMB).
**Municipal Licensing:** (In cities with additional local requirements).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Therapist names and photos are sensitive. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Scraping" of the practitioner database by predatory recruiters or harassers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Massage therapy boards issue professional licenses under occupational regulator authority (GCMT in the UK).

```
✓ gcmt.org.uk/register/verify — Issues massage therapy licenses
  ✓ gcmt.org.uk — Registers massage therapists in the UK
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the board's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (license number, issue date, expiration date, license status) — never therapist name, address, or background check details — providing non-repudiation of the license and an audit trail law enforcement can inspect.


## Competition vs. Window Posters / Public Lookup

| Feature | Live Verify | Laminated Wall Poster | State Website Search |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Board. | **Visual.** Trusted via logo only. | **High.** Direct DB access. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the door. | **N/A.** Just looking. | **Slow.** Requires typing names and navigating portals. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to status. | **Zero.** Easily swapped. | **None.** |
| **Safety Data** | **High.** Shows background check status. | **None.** | **Passive.** |

**Why this remains strong:** State portal lookup should remain primary where a verifier is prepared to use it directly. But in the actual service setting, the visible station license or displayed credential is the surface the client encounters. That makes this a good complementary case for discreet, in-room verification rather than a claim to replace the registry.
