## What is a Doping Record?

In professional sports, athletes are constantly tested for performance-enhancing drugs.

The **Doping Control Record** is the proof of a clean test. It is the "Moral Passport" for an athlete.

Because a "Positive Test" can end a multimillion-dollar career, fraud is a high risk. Shady labs or athletes sometimes "Swap" samples or forge "Negative" certificates to keep competing. Verified hashes allow sports federations and sponsors to see the **un-altered result** directly from the WADA-accredited lab's domain.

## Data Verified

Athlete identifier (masked), Sample ID number, type of sample (Urine/Blood), date/time of collection, test result (Negative/Adverse Finding), testing lab accreditation, Doping Control Officer (DCO) ID, event name.

**Document Types:**
- **Doping Control Form (DCF):** The 3-copy carbon paper signed at collection.
- **Laboratory Result Certificate:** Formal proof of a "Clean" test.
- **TUE (Therapeutic Use Exemption):** Proving a medication was authorized.
- **Whereabouts Confirmation:** Proving an athlete was where they claimed to be.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`wada-ama.org`, `usada.org`) and current sample status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Negative** — No banned substances found.
- **Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF)** — **ALERT:** Banned substance detected.
- **Pending** — Sample in transit or undergoing analysis.
- **Void** — Chain of custody broken; sample inadmissible.

## Second-Party Use

The **Athlete** benefits from verification.

**Sponsorship Integrity:** Proving to a major sponsor (e.g., Nike or Red Bull) that a recent "Drug Test" claim is verified by a WADA-accredited lab. This is crucial for maintaining endorsement income after a scandal or a rival's accusation.

**League Eligibility:** Providing verified proof of a clean test to a new professional league or international team during a transfer.

**Public Reputation:** Athletes accused of doping can use verified, timestamped "Negative" hashes to defend their reputation in the media.

## Third-Party Use

**Sports Federations (NGBs)**
**Eligibility Vetting:** Instantly verifying the "Clean History" of an athlete before they are allowed to compete in a championship event.

**Sports Media / Journalists**
**Fact Checking:** Verifying the authenticity of "Clean Certificates" posted by athletes on social media during a doping controversy.

**Event Organizers**
**Mass Participation Safety:** For major marathons (e.g., Boston/London), verifying the drug testing status of elite entries.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Clean" Fraud Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** Using a high-quality template to create a "Clean Test" letter from a famous lab like UCLA or Seibersdorf.
- **Sample ID Swapping:** Taking a clean result for Sample #123 and editing the name/date to match a dirty Sample #456.
- **Chain of Custody Erasure:** Editing a "Chain of Custody Exception" report to hide that a sample was left unrefrigerated.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).**
**National Anti-Doping Orgs:** (USADA, UKAD, ASADA).
**Accredited Laboratories.**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Doping data is highly sensitive health info. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for famous athletes to see their test results.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

WADA-accredited laboratories conduct drug tests according to international anti-doping protocols.

```
✓ testing.ukad.org.uk — Conducts WADA-accredited doping tests
  ✓ wada-ama.org — Sets global anti-doping standards
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the testing lab's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (sample ID, event name, collection date and time, test result, lab accreditation, doping control officer ID) — never plaintext athlete identity — providing non-repudiation of the anti-doping test result.


## Competition vs. ADAMS Database

| Feature | Live Verify | ADAMS Portal (WADA) | Scanned PDF / Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds Sample to Result. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Accessibility** | **Open.** Any sponsor or journalist can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires private credentials. | **Instant.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires login and manual ID search. | **Instant.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone. | **Technical.** Requires laptop/dedicated app. | **Manual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Transparency Bridge." WADA's ADAMS database is a "Fortress"—only officials can see it. But the **Athlete** needs to prove their clean status to the **Public** and **Sponsors**. Live Verify turns the "Private Record" into a "Publicly Verifiable Truth" without exposing the entire secret database.
