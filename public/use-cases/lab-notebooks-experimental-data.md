## Data Verified

Notebook ID, page number, researcher name, principal investigator (PI) name, witness name, timestamp (to the second), experiment title/ID, summary of findings (digest), checksum of attached raw data files, institutional domain.

**Document Types:**
- **Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) Page:** Digital-native records.
- **Physical Notebook Scan:** Handwritten pages witnessed and hashed.
- **Experimental Protocol:** (Linked hash) proving the methods used.
- **Raw Data Manifest:** Linking large datasets to the summary.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`stanford.edu`, `pfizer.com`, `nature.com`) and the record standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Entry is verified and matches the institutional vault.
- **Under Correction** — Researcher has noted a post-entry error or addendum.
- **Retracted** — **ALERT:** Data found to be fraudulent or non-reproducible.
- **IP Protection** — Verified existence for patent "First-to-Invent" claims.

## Second-Party Use

The **Lead Researcher / PI** benefits from verification.

**Patent Defense:** Proving to the USPTO or a patent court that a specific discovery happened on March 15, 2026. A verified, timestamped hash from the university's domain is the "Gold Standard" evidence for defending intellectual property against rival claims.

**Journal Submission:** Providing verified links to the original lab notes in a peer-reviewed submission (e.g., to *Nature* or *Cell*). This builds massive trust with reviewers by proving the data hasn't been "Massaged" post-hoc to fit a narrative.

## Third-Party Use

**University Compliance Officers**
**Integrity Audit:** Instantly verifying that all data in a high-profile study has a verified digital chain of custody. Live Verify prevents "Data Fabrication" where a researcher invents results in their bedroom without real lab work.

**Patent Attorneys**
**Prior Art Search:** Verifying the "First Publication Date" of a competitor's experimental data to determine if a patent is valid.

**Regulatory Agencies (FDA / NIH)**
**Grant Oversight:** Ensuring that taxpayer-funded research is being documented according to verified "Good Laboratory Practice" (GLP) standards.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Scientific Fraud" Problem**

- **Post-Hoc Data Smoothing:** Deleting "Outlier" data points from a digital log after the experiment is over to make the results look more significant.
- **Fabricated Witnesses:** Forging a colleague's signature on a paper notebook page to meet institutional "Dual-Signoff" rules.
- **Ghost Notes:** Creating fake entries for experiments that never happened to justify a grant renewal.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Research Universities.**
**Pharma/Biotech R&D Units.**
**ELN Software Vendors:** (e.g., Benchling, LabArchives - hosting the hashes).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Experimental results are proprietary IP. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "IP Poaching" where competitors try to guess findings before they are patented.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Research institutions issue verified lab notebook records certifying experimental data and witnessing. The issuer is self-authorized as the institutional authority responsible for research integrity.

```
✓ lab.example-university.ac.uk/notebook/verify — Certifies lab notebook entries with witness signatures and timestamps
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the researcher's or institution's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the lab notebook or experimental data.

## Competition vs. Blockchain (Ocean Protocol)

| Feature | Live Verify | Science Blockchain (Ocean/DeSci) | ELN Audit Log |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the University. | **Consensus-Bound.** Trust the network. | **System-Bound.** |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** PDFs stay verifiable across institutions. | **Low.** Requires all partners to use the same chain. | **Zero.** |
| **Content Link** | **Binds Summary.** Protects the *Message*. | **Binds Files.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Medium.** Gas fees and storage costs. | **High.** Enterprise license fees. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Handoff Gap." Science is collaborative. A researcher at Stanford shares a PDF summary with a partner at MIT. The partner doesn't have access to Stanford's private LabArchives server. Live Verify turns that **PDF Summary** into a live digital anchor, providing "Blockchain Integrity" without the "Blockchain Complexity."
