## What are Workplace Postings?

Mandatory workplace postings are government-required notices that inform workers of their rights regarding safety, wages, discrimination, and leave. These must be posted in conspicuous locations accessible to all employees, typically employee breakrooms, hallways, or near time clocks.

The problem is that these posters are often outdated or even fraudulent. Employers may fail to update posters when laws change, or private vendors may sell expensive poster bundles that are actually free from the government.

This is therefore primarily a **publication-distribution** problem. The best fix is usually a direct official URL, QR code, or stable agency PDF page. Live Verify is only a secondary fit if the goal is to make the physical poster itself a human-readable bridge to the official source without relying on an opaque code.

## Key Examples

### Health & Safety (OSHA)
*   **Purpose:** Inform workers of their right to a safe workplace and how to report hazards.
*   **Risk:** Fake posters might omit the right to request an inspection or list an internal HR number instead of the official hotline.

### Wages & Hours (FLSA)
*   **Purpose:** Display current federal/state minimum wage and overtime rules.
*   **Risk:** "Wage theft" via altered posters that misstate the "Tip Credit" or overtime eligibility.

### Employee Rights & Leave (FMLA, PUMP Act)
*   **Purpose:** Detail rights to unpaid, job-protected leave or lactation accommodations.
*   **Risk:** Employers inflating eligibility requirements to discourage leave.

## Verification Architecture

**The Poster Fraud Problem**

- **Outdated Info:** Keeping a 2022 minimum wage poster up in 2026.
- **Selective Deletion:** Removing the section on "Union Rights" from an EEO poster.
- **Compliance Scams:** Forcing businesses to buy "certified" posters that are actually home-printed fakes.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Federal Agencies (DOL, OSHA, EEOC).**
**State Departments of Labor.**
**Municipal Labor Standards Offices.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

The Health and Safety Executive regulates workplace safety and issues official poster requirements under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

```
✓ hse.gov.uk/workplace/verify — HSE workplace health and safety posting service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Workplace postings are the "Bill of Rights" for the breakroom. But the main product here is still the agency's current poster page. A verification layer is only secondary to that simpler direct-link distribution model.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the government agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (posting title, effective date, jurisdiction) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the workplace posting.
