## What are Recurring Organizational Votes?

Organizations regularly need members to vote or provide feedback:
- Unions vote on contracts
- HOAs vote on rules and budgets
- Employees complete surveys
- Co-ops elect boards
- Professional associations set policies

These votes require two things that seem contradictory:
1. **Eligibility verification** — Only members can vote
2. **Ballot secrecy** — No one knows how you voted

Identity escrow provides both: verified eligibility, anonymous participation.

## Derivation 1: Union Contract Votes

**The Problem:**
Union contract ratification votes are high stakes. Employers have incentives to:
- Identify "no" voters for retaliation
- Challenge vote legitimacy if results are unfavorable
- Claim non-members voted

Paper ballots in a hall solve secrecy but require physical presence. Digital voting risks both eligibility fraud and vote exposure.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

Vote ID: UV-2025-0114-REDACTED
Election: 2025 Contract Ratification

VOTER: Verified Member #V-REDACTED
  - Membership verified with Union Local 302
  - Good standing confirmed as of vote date
  - One vote cast (no duplicates)

BALLOT STATUS: Recorded
VOTE CONTENT: [Not stored - secret ballot]

This receipt confirms you voted. It does not
record how you voted. Your vote was counted
in the official tally.

Election results: verify:local302.org/elections

<span data-verify-line="union">verify:local302.org/vote/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="union"></span></pre>
</div>

**How It Works:**
1. Union maintains membership roster
2. Escrow verifies voter is on roster, in good standing
3. Voter receives one-time voting token (unlinkable to identity)
4. Vote cast using token (not identity)
5. Escrow confirms vote counted without recording content

**What Gets Verified:**
- Voter is current union member
- Voter is in good standing (dues paid)
- Voter hasn't already voted
- Vote was recorded

**What's NOT Recorded:**
- How the voter voted
- Any link between identity and ballot
- Any way to prove how someone voted (even to themselves)

**Recount/Audit Capability:**
- Total votes can be verified
- Individual ballots can be recounted
- But ballots cannot be linked to voters

**Coercion Resistance:**
- Voter cannot prove how they voted (even if coerced to try)
- Receipt confirms participation, not content
- Protects workers from employer or union pressure

## Derivation 2: HOA Votes

**The Problem:**
Homeowner Association votes are contentious:
- Votes on special assessments (money)
- Votes on rule changes (lifestyle)
- Board elections (power)

Neighbors know each other. Voting positions can create lasting conflicts. But only owners should vote, and each property gets one vote.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

PROPERTY: Unit verified (address not shown)
VOTER: Verified Owner #O-REDACTED

<span data-verify-line="hoa">verify:oakwoodhoa.org/vote/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="hoa"></span></pre>
</div>

**Ownership Verification:**
- Title records confirm property ownership
- Handles co-owners (who gets to vote?)
- Handles trusts and LLCs (beneficial owner verification)

**Voting Weight:**
- Some HOAs weight by property size or value
- Escrow can apply weights without revealing voter identity
- Commercial HOAs may have complex ownership structures

**Proxy Handling:**
- Owners can assign proxy to another owner
- Proxy verified but kept private
- No one knows who's voting for whom

## Derivation 3: Employee Engagement Surveys

**The Problem:**
Companies want honest feedback from employees. But employees fear:
- Retaliation for negative feedback
- Being identified by writing style or specific complaints
- Managers seeing individual responses

"Anonymous" surveys run by HR aren't trusted—employees suspect they're not really anonymous.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="survey"></span>EMPLOYEE SURVEY VERIFICATION

Survey: Q1 2025 Engagement Survey
Company: Acme Corporation

RESPONDENT: Verified Employee #E-REDACTED
  - Employment verified via HR system
  - Department: [Not disclosed to employer]
  - Tenure: [Not disclosed to employer]

RESPONSE STATUS: Submitted
RESPONSE CONTENT: [Held by independent escrow]

Your employer receives only aggregate statistics.
Individual responses are never shared.
Free-text responses are reviewed for themes only.

<span data-verify-line="survey">verify:surveyshield.org/response/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="survey"></span></pre>
</div>

**Third-Party Escrow:**
- Survey run by independent firm (not HR)
- Employer never receives individual responses
- Employer receives aggregate data only
- Free-text analyzed for themes, not individual review

**Demographic Bucketing:**
- Small departments may be identifiable
- Escrow suppresses small buckets (minimum 5 responses to report)
- "Your team" data only shown if team is large enough

**What Employer Gets:**
- Response rate
- Aggregate scores by question
- Theme analysis of free-text
- Trends over time (if recurring)

**What Employer Does NOT Get:**
- Individual responses
- Small-group breakdowns
- Any way to identify who said what

**Employee Trust:**
- Third-party escrow has no relationship with employer
- Technical architecture prevents employer access
- Escrow's business model depends on trust

## Derivation 4: Co-op and Credit Union Member Votes

**The Problem:**
Member-owned organizations (co-ops, credit unions, mutual insurance companies) require member voting for:
- Board elections
- Bylaw changes
- Merger decisions
- Policy directions

Members may have varying stakes (shares, account sizes) but equal voting rights. Verification and secrecy both matter.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="coop"></span>MEMBER VOTE VERIFICATION

Organization: Green Valley Food Co-op
Election: 2025 Board of Directors

VOTER: Verified Member #M-REDACTED
  - Membership verified
  - Member since: [Year only: 2018]
  - One member, one vote confirmed

BALLOT STATUS: Cast
VOTE CONTENT: [Not stored - secret ballot]

Results announced at Annual Meeting, March 15.

<span data-verify-line="coop">verify:greenvalley.coop/vote/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="coop"></span></pre>
</div>

**Member Verification:**
- Account in good standing
- Membership share paid
- Not a staff/board member (if separate voting categories)

**Voting Variations:**
- One member, one vote (most common)
- Proportional to patronage (some co-ops)
- Different categories (consumer members, producer members)

**Remote Voting:**
- Many co-op members can't attend meetings
- Digital voting with verified identity enables participation
- Combines with in-person voting seamlessly

## Verification Architecture

**The Core Problem: Eligibility + Secrecy**

Traditional approaches fail at one or the other:

| Method | Eligibility | Secrecy | Problem |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Show of hands | ✓ | ✗ | Everyone sees your vote |
| Paper ballot, no check-in | ✗ | ✓ | Anyone can vote |
| Paper ballot with roster | ✓ | Partial | Vote order may reveal |
| Digital login + vote | ✓ | ✗ | Vote linked to identity |
| Anonymous digital | ✗ | ✓ | Can't verify eligibility |

**Identity Escrow Solves This:**

1. **Eligibility check:** Voter proves membership to escrow
2. **Token issuance:** Escrow issues unlinkable voting token
3. **Vote casting:** Token used to vote (no identity attached)
4. **Verification:** Voter receives receipt (proves participation, not content)

**Cryptographic Foundations:**

Real implementations use:
- Blind signatures (token is signed but issuer can't link)
- Zero-knowledge proofs (prove eligibility without revealing identity)
- Mix networks (shuffle votes to break ordering)
- Homomorphic encryption (count encrypted votes)

This use case documents the *concept*; implementations require specialized voting technology.

**Coercion Resistance:**

The gold standard is that voters cannot prove how they voted:
- No receipt of vote content
- No way to show anyone your ballot
- Protects against vote buying and intimidation

Some implementations allow voters to verify their own vote was counted (without proving to others), using techniques like receipt-free voting or deniable receipts.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Organizations conducting member votes (unions, HOAs, co-ops, employee surveys) are themselves the source of authority for electoral integrity.

```

```

Self-authorized — this is a sovereign body (organization) whose authority derives from statute or membership agreement.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Recurring Vote Patterns

**Why Recurring Matters:**

Organizations vote repeatedly:
- Annual board elections
- Quarterly budget approvals
- Regular contract renegotiations
- Ongoing policy changes

Identity escrow provides:
- **Persistent eligibility:** Verify once, vote many times
- **Turnover handling:** New members added, departed removed
- **Consistent trust:** Same independent escrow each time
- **Historical integrity:** Past votes remain sealed

**Eligibility Updates:**
- Real-time roster sync with organization
- Grace periods for membership lapses
- Clear cutoff dates for each vote

## Jurisdictional Considerations

**Labor Law (Union Votes):**
- NLRA requires secret ballot for certain votes
- NLRB may oversee elections
- Identity escrow must meet NLRB standards

**Corporate Law (HOA/Co-op Votes):**
- State laws govern proxy voting
- Quorum requirements
- Record retention requirements

**Employment Law (Surveys):**
- NLRA protects concerted activity (includes surveys about working conditions)
- Can't retaliate for survey responses
- Third-party escrow strengthens legal protection

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the organization's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (election ID, vote count, result announced date) — never individual ballots, voter identities, or voting patterns — providing non-repudiation of the election and an audit trail members can inspect.
