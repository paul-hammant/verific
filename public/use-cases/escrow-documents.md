## What is an Escrow Statement?

If you have a mortgage, your bank often collects extra money every month to pay your property taxes and home insurance for you. This "bucket" of money is your **Escrow Account**.

Every year, the bank sends you an **Annual Escrow Analysis**. It tells you if you have too much money in the bucket (a Surplus) or too little (a Shortage).

Because banks manage millions of these accounts, clerical errors are frequent. Verified statements allow homeowners to prove the bank's math is wrong if a "Shortage Notice" doesn't match the county's actual tax bill.

</div>

## Data Verified

Loan number, property address, homeowner name, total disbursements (Taxes/Insurance), beginning/ending balance, projected payment change, next year's cushion amount, date of analysis, servicer ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Annual Escrow Analysis:** The mandatory yearly review.
- **Escrow Refund Check:** Proving a surplus was returned to the owner.
- **Shortage/Deficiency Notice:** Demanding extra funds.
- **Disbursement Receipt:** (Linked hash) proving taxes were paid to the county.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`mrcooper.com`, `wellsfargo.com`) and current account status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Statement matches the servicer's official financial record.
- **Amended** — A correction was issued (e.g., due to updated tax bill).
- **Settled** — Surplus refund has been issued and cleared.
- **In-Dispute** — Homeowner has formally challenged the analysis.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner (Borrower)** (second party) receives the escrow statement from the mortgage servicer (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the escrow analysis. Most of the time, the statement sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the statement matches what the servicer's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about escrow calculations, payment increases, or shortages, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the servicer.

## Third-Party Use

The homeowner (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**
**Complaint Resolution:** When a homeowner files a complaint about escrow mismanagement, they can provide verified hashes of their statements. "Verified by Mr. Cooper" prevents the servicer from claiming "We have no record of that statement" during the investigation.

**Tax Assessors / County Collectors**
**Payment Reconciliation:** Verifying that the amount the servicer *claims* to have sent for property taxes matches what the county actually received, catching "Lost in the Mail" payments before penalties accrue.

**Hazard Insurers**
**Premium Verification:** Ensuring the servicer has the correct, verified premium amount in their escrow projection, preventing coverage lapses due to under-funding.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Escrow Black Box" Fraud Problem**

- **Surplus Retraction:** A servicer showing a "Surplus" on the paper statement but then quietly "Adjusting" it to zero in the system after the homeowner stops looking.
- **Phantom Withdrawals:** Withdrawing money from the escrow for "Administrative Fees" that aren't disclosed on the paper statement.
- **Backdating Notices:** Fabricating a "Shortage Notice" today but dating it 3 months ago to justify an immediate payment increase without the mandatory 30-day RESPA warning.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Mortgage Servicers (Mr. Cooper, PennyMac, Rocket Mortgage)
- Banks & Credit Unions
- Sub-Servicers (Cenlar, LoanCare - hosting on behalf of lenders)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Escrow statements contain a mix of enumerable and unique values—loan numbers that might follow predictable patterns, property addresses that are public records, and round dollar amounts for taxes and insurance. While some elements are unique, the hash must be salted to prevent unauthorized enumeration of homeowner financial data and to protect the privacy of escrow account details from being discovered through brute-force attempts.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the servicer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (loan number, disbursement amounts, balance changes, payment adjustments) — never homeowner names, property addresses, or personal financial details — providing non-repudiation of the escrow statement issuance and immutable proof critical for RESPA compliance disputes.

## Competition vs. Servicer Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | Servicer Mobile App | Scanned PDF / Printout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects every line item. | **Dynamic.** Data can change without audit trail. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Dispute Power** | **High.** Proves the servicer's *past* attestation. | **Low.** Servicer controls the app view. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Audit-ability** | **High.** Creates an external digital trail. | **None.** For external regulators. | **Manual.** |
| **Transparency** | **High.** Shows exact RESPA math. | **Medium.** Often hides complex calculations. | **Full.** But untrusted. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Audit Gap." Mortgage servicers often have terrible record-keeping systems. When a homeowner disputes a bill, the servicer often says "The app is showing the latest data; your old paper is wrong." Live Verify turns that **Old Paper Statement** into an un-erasable digital proof of what the servicer claimed on that date, empowering the homeowner in disputes.

## What are Escrow Wire Instructions?

When you buy a house, you must wire your life savings (the downpayment) to a title company. This is the **most dangerous moment** in a person's financial life.

Hackers often "spoof" an escrow officer's email and send "Updated Wire Instructions" with their own bank account. This is called **Wire Fraud**, and it costs homebuyers $400 million a year.

**Verified Wire Instructions** provide a "Digital Shield." By scanning the hash on the PDF, the buyer gets 100% confirmation from the title company's domain that the bank details are real *before* they hit "Send" at the bank.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

</div>

## Data Verified

Escrow number, Property address, Buyer/Seller names, Beneficiary Bank name, Routing/Account numbers, exact wire amount authorized, Escrow Officer ID, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Wire Instructions:** The high-risk "Target #1" for fraudsters.
- **Closing Disclosure (CD):** Proving the final $ amounts.
- **ALTA Settlement Statement:** Detailed breakdown of all fees.
- **Grant Deed:** (Linked hash) for recording verification.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`firstam.com`, `fnf.com`, `stewart.com`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized** — Bank details match the official firm record.
- **Urgent: Changed** — **ALERT:** Instructions have been updated; do not use old ones.
- **Closed** — Escrow complete; funds should not be sent.
- **Invalid** — Serial number or bank data mismatch (High fraud risk).

## Second-Party Use

The **Buyer / Seller** (second party) receives the wire instructions from the title company (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the wire instructions. Most of the time, the instructions sit in their closing folder—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the wire instructions match what the title company's system recorded and haven't been altered by a hacker.

**Future Optionality:** If a wire fraud incident occurs or a dispute arises about the closing, they have cryptographic proof of the authentic instructions ready without needing to contact the title company.

## Third-Party Use

The buyer/seller (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**The Buyer's Bank (Sending Bank)**
**Fraud Vetting:** Before executing a high-value real estate wire, the bank's fraud team can scan the instructions. "Verified by First American" provides the green light needed to bypass additional "Confirm by Phone" delays.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Closing Integrity:** Ensuring that the "Closing Disclosure" in the loan file is the exact same one signed by the borrower and the escrow officer, with no secret "fees" or altered payouts.

**Title Insurers**
**Risk Underwriting:** Verifying that the instructions and payouts followed the verified legal chain to avoid future "Mechanics Lien" or "Unsatisfied Mortgage" claims.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Real Estate Wire" Fraud Problem**

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** Hackers taking over an escrow officer's email and sending "Updated Wire Instructions" with their own bank account. This causes $400M+ in losses annually.
- **PDF Scams:** Scammers sending fake "Closing Disclosures" to borrowers to steal the downpayment.
- **Settlement Tampering:** Editing a PDF to change the "Seller Payout" to a fraudster's account.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- National Title Companies (First American, Fidelity, Old Republic)
- Regional Escrow Firms
- Attorney Closers (in "Attorney States")

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Wire instructions contain highly sensitive data—bank account numbers, routing numbers, and large transaction amounts. While some elements like escrow numbers are unique, the hash must be salted to prevent enumeration attacks that could reveal transaction patterns, amounts, or banking relationships. This is critical for preventing both fraud reconnaissance and privacy violations involving substantial financial transfers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Escrow companies are licensed by state regulators to hold funds during real estate closings.

```
✓ escrow.firstam.com — Holds escrow funds for real estate transactions
  ✓ dfi.ca.gov — Regulates California financial institutions
    ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the title company's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (escrow number, transaction amount, wire date, title company ID) — never buyer/seller names, property addresses, or bank account details — providing non-repudiation of wire instruction issuance and immutable proof critical for wire fraud investigations.

## Competition vs. Secure Portals (Qualia)

| Feature | Live Verify | Secure Portal (Qualia/CertifID) | Scanned PDF / Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Firm. | **System-Bound.** Trust the vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Accessibility** | **Universal.** No login needed to verify. | **Difficult.** Requires buyer to create an account/password. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the account #. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone. | **Technical.** Often requires desktop browser. | **Manual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Moment of Action." A buyer is standing at their bank's wire desk. They are nervous. They don't want to struggle with a "Secure Portal" login or a forgotten password. Live Verify turns the **Printed Wire Instructions** into a live, high-speed trust bridge, providing "Bank-Grade" security with "Paper-Grade" simplicity.

## What is an M&A Settlement Statement?

When one company buys another, millions of dollars move through an **Escrow Agent**. The **Settlement Statement** is the final "Math Sheet" that everyone signs.

It lists:
1.  **The Purchase Price:** (e.g., $100,000,000).
2.  **The Holdback:** Money kept in escrow for a year to cover hidden debts.
3.  **The Payouts:** Exactly how much goes to each shareholder and lawyer.

In high-stakes deals, fraudsters (or disgruntled partners) often "Edit" the PDF statement to hide secret fees or to trick a bank into believing a deal was larger than it actually was. Verified hashes turn these private legal papers into an un-erasable proof of the deal's final math.

## Data Verified

Deal Name, Buyer/Seller entities, Gross Purchase Price, Holdback/Indemnity amounts, Working Capital adjustments, Net Payouts, Closing Date, Escrow Agent ID.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`jpmorgan.com`, `citibank.com`) and current fund status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Settled** — All funds have been disbursed.
- **Holdback Active** — Funds are still being held in escrow.
- **Disputed** — An indemnity claim has been filed against the escrow.
- **Void** — Transaction cancelled post-signing.

## Second-Party Use

The **Selling Shareholders** (second party) receive the settlement statement from the escrow agent (first party), **keep it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the deal terms and payout breakdown. Most of the time, the statement sits in their financial records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the statement matches what the escrow agent's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about holdback releases, indemnity claims, or tax reporting, they have cryptographic proof of the settlement ready without needing to contact the escrow agent.

## Third-Party Use

The selling shareholders (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Lenders (Acquisition Finance)**
**Funding Verification:** Ensuring that the loan funds the bank provided were actually used for the acquisition and not diverted to secret offshore accounts.

**Future Buyers (Secondary M&A)**
**History Audit:** If the company is sold again 5 years later, the new buyer can verify the original "Purchase Price" and "Holdback Release" terms from the digital hash.

## Competition vs. Virtual Data Rooms (VDR)

| Feature | Live Verify | VDR (Intralinks / Merrill) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Share with any tax auditor. | **Restricted.** Access usually revoked after 90 days. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Bank. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Permanence** | **Permanent.** Binds the *text* forever. | **Temporary.** Portals are deal-specific. | **Durable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:**
The "Post-Deal Gap." Three years after a deal closes, the VDR is gone and the lawyers have moved on. When an IRS auditor or a new buyer asks for proof, the **Static PDF** is all that's left. Live Verify turns that PDF into a permanent, verifiable "Source of Truth."

## What are Escrow Instructions?

When a house is sold, the **Escrow Officer** is the neutral umpire. They hold the money and wait for the "Instructions" from both parties.

These **Instructions** are the legal blueprints for the payout. They tell the officer exactly who to pay:
1.  **The Seller:** "Pay them $400,000."
2.  **The Bank:** "Pay off the existing $200,000 mortgage."
3.  **The Tax Man:** "Pay the county $5,000 in property tax."

Fraud is rampant: scammers often send fake "Updated Instructions" to the escrow officer to divert the seller's money to a foreign bank account. Verified hashes allow the officer to verify the **authenticity of the signature and the bank details** on the paper instructions.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

## Data Verified

Escrow number, Property address, Seller/Recipient name, Beneficiary Bank, Routing/Account numbers, total payout amount, date of signing, Escrow Officer name.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`stewart.com`, `firstam.com`) and current authorization status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized** — Instructions match the signed record in the file.
- **Changed** — **ALERT:** New instructions have been received; older versions are void.
- **Executed** — Money has already been sent; no further changes allowed.
- **Hold** — Under investigation for suspected wire fraud.

## Second-Party Use

The **Seller** (second party) receives the disbursement authorization from the title company (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the disbursement instructions. Most of the time, the authorization sits in their closing records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the instructions match what the title company's system recorded and haven't been altered by a fraudster.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises about where funds were sent or wire fraud occurs, they have cryptographic proof of the authentic disbursement authorization ready without needing to contact the title company.

## Third-Party Use

The seller (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Escrow Officers / Title Clerks**
**Wire Validation:** Before hitting "Send" on a $500,000 wire, the clerk scans the paper instructions. "Verified by Seller" provides the legal protection needed to release funds.

**Banks (Receiving Bank)**
**KYC/Source of Wealth:** Verifying the "Disbursement Logic" behind a large incoming wire to ensure it matches a legitimate real estate sale.

## Competition vs. Secure Portals (CertifID)

| Feature | Live Verify | CertifID / Secure Portal | Scanned PDF / Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Title Co. | **System-Bound.** Trust the vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Ease of Use** | **High.** Scan the paper at the desk. | **Medium.** Requires setting up a portal login. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds All Data.** Protects every digit. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Legal Status** | **Cryptographic Artifact.** | **Platform Service.** | **Vulnerable PDF.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:**
The "Closing Room" reality. Closings often happen at a conference table with physical papers. Sellers and Buyers are often older and not tech-savvy. They don't want to "Login to a Portal." They want to sign a piece of paper. Live Verify turns that **Signed Paper** into a high-security digital key that even a hacker in a different country cannot spoof.
