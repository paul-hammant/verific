## What is a Stormwater Discharge Permit?

In the industrial and construction sectors, a **Stormwater Discharge Permit** (under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System - **NPDES**) is the legal authorization to allow rainwater to run off a site into local rivers or oceans. Because rainwater can pick up heavy metals, oils, and silt, these permits define strict **Pollutant Limits** and require constant monitoring.

These permits are the "Permission to Pollute" within legal bounds. Fraud is common in high-impact industries (e.g., Mining, Manufacturing): operators might "edit" a permit to hide a "Toxicity Limit" or to change the "Authorized Outfall" location to a less-monitored area. Verified hashes bind the **Facility ID, Pollutant Limits, and Discharge Points** to the state's or the EPA's domain (e.g., `epa.gov` or `water-quality.gov`).

## Data Verified

Permit number (NPDES), permittee name, facility address, facility ID, industrial SIC/NAICS code, authorized outfall IDs, pollutant concentration limits (TSS, pH, Oil), monitoring frequency, effective/expiration dates, state/federal issuing office, date of last site audit.

**Document Types:**
- **NPDES Discharge Permit:** The primary multi-year authorization.
- **Notice of Intent (NOI):** Proof of application for coverage.
- **Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR):** (Linked hash) the monthly lab results.
- **SWPPP (Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan):** The detailed site map.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`epa.gov`, `dep.state.gov`, `water-quality.gov`) and the permit standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Compliant** — Permit is current and monitoring results are up-to-date.
- **Violation Flag** — **CRITICAL:** Recent lab tests exceeded the legal pollutant limits.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The 5-year permit window has lapsed; re-application required.
- **Suspended** — **CRITICAL:** Discharge authority revoked due to negligence.

## Second-Party Use

The **Facility Manager / HSE Officer** benefits from verification.

**Supply Chain Vetting:** When a large company (e.g., Apple or Unilever) audits their suppliers, the factory manager provides the verified hash of their NPDES permit. The corporate auditor can instantly see **"VERIFIED COMPLIANT"** on their phone, removing the need for a 3-day manual review of state database archives.

**Regulatory Defense:** During a routine site inspection, the manager can show the verified "Current" hash to the agent. This proves the facility is operating under the *latest* approved limits, protecting them from "Old Data" citations.

## Third-Party Use

**Environmental NGO / Citizen Groups**
**Watchdog Audit:** A community group concerned about local water quality can scan the placard at a factory's fence. If the hash returns **"VIOLATION FLAG,"** they have the verified evidence needed to file a citizen suit under the Clean Water Act.

**Lenders and Real Estate Appraisers**
**Environmental Due Diligence:** Before financing an industrial property, the bank's underwriter scans the verified permit hashes. This ensures the site isn't a "Compliance Liability" that would cost millions in future state fines.

**Municipal Sewer Authorities**
**System Integrity:** Verifying that "Pre-Treatment" and "Stormwater" connections match the verified permit limits, preventing industrial slugs from damaging the municipal treatment plant.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Cloudy Water" Fraud Problem**

- **Limit Stretching:** Editing a TSS limit of "50 mg/L" to "500 mg/L" on a paper copy to hide massive pollution.
- **Outfall Masking:** Changing the authorized discharge point from a "Protected Wetland" to a "General Stream" on a PDF map.
- **Ghost Permits:** Creating a fake NPDES number for an unlicensed industrial site.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).**
**State Environmental Protection Agencies (DEPs).**
**Regional Water Quality Control Boards.**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. These are public environmental permits by law. However, individual facility contact names and internal production volumes should be salted to protect business privacy.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

The Environment Agency issues stormwater and wastewater discharge permits under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2016.

```
✓ environment-agency.gov.uk/npdes/verify — Environment Agency discharge and effluent permits
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Water quality is a "Downstream Risk." By turning static permits into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that "Clean Water" is backed by cryptographic proof, protecting local watersheds and ensuring that industrial accountability is a digital fact.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the EPA's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (permit number, permittee name, facility address, facility ID, authorized outfall IDs, pollutant concentration limits, effective/expiration dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the discharge permit.
