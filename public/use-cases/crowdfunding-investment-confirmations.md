## What is a Pledge Confirmation?

When you back a project on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, you are often buying a "Future Product" (like a new watch or board game).

The **Pledge Confirmation** is your receipt. It proves you were "Backer #4" and are entitled to a specific "Early Bird" reward.

In the "Secondary Market" for gadgets, people often try to sell their "Reservation Spots" to others. Verified hashes prevent "Vapor-Pledge" fraud where someone tries to sell a high-value reward tier they never actually bought.

## Data Verified

Backer name, project title, pledge amount, reward tier description, estimated delivery date, project creator name, transaction date, unique pledge ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Pledge Confirmation:** For reward-based sites (Kickstarter/Indiegogo).
- **Equity Certificate:** For investment-based sites (Wefunder/Republic).
- **Tax Receipt:** For charitable crowdfunding (GoFundMe).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`kickstarter.com`, `wefunder.com`) and pledge status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Collected** — Funds successfully charged to backer.
- **Refunded** — Campaign failed or creator issued a refund.
- **Cancelled** — Backer withdrew pledge before deadline.
- **Shipped** — Creator has verified delivery of reward.

## Second-Party Use

The **Backer / Investor** benefits from verification.

**Secondary Market:** If a backer wants to sell their "Founder's Edition" serial number before the product even ships, they can show a potential buyer the "Verified Pledge" from Kickstarter. This prevents "Vapor-Pledge" fraud where someone tries to sell a reward they never actually bought.

**Dispute Resolution:** Proving to a credit card company that a $1,200 charge was for a specific "Founder's Edition" reward if the creator tries to send a cheaper "Basic Edition" instead.

## Third-Party Use

**Project Creators**
**Inventory Audit:** Instantly verifying the eligibility of a backer during a face-to-face pickup event at a launch party.

**Platform Safety Teams**
**Shill Bidding Detection:** Verifying the authenticity of large, unusual pledges to ensure they aren't "Fake" pledges from the creator's friends to pump up the campaign's popularity.

**Tax Accountants**
**Donation Verification:** Verifying that a large "Pledge" to a non-profit crowdfunding campaign is a legitimate tax-deductible event.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Vapor-Pledge" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Confirmations:** Scammers creating fake Kickstarter emails to trick people into buying "Resale Spots" for a sold-out gadget.
- **Amount Tampering:** Editing a $10 pledge to look like a $1,000 "Titanium Tier" pledge to gain access to exclusive creator forums or events.
- **Status Faking:** Showing a "Sent" status on a PDF when the payment actually failed.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Reward Platforms:** (Kickstarter, Indiegogo).
**Equity Crowdfunding Portals:** (Wefunder, SeedInvest).
**Philanthropy Platforms:** (GoFundMe, Classy).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Pledges can reveal personal interests and political affiliations. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guessing" names of backers for controversial projects.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Seedrs issues investment confirmations for UK crowdfunding platforms.

```
✓ invest.seedrs.com/confirm/verify — Issues investment confirmations for crowdfunding platforms
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK investment firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the crowdfunding platform's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (backer name, project title, pledge amount, reward tier, estimated delivery date, transaction date, pledge ID) — never plaintext payment information — providing non-repudiation of the pledge confirmation.


## Competition vs. Platform Dashboards

| Feature | Live Verify | Platform Dashboard | Scanned PDF / Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Platform. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for secondary sales. | **Siloed.** Hard to prove status to a 3rd party buyer. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Tier.** Protects the "Reward Level." | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires 2FA and navigation. | **N/A.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Handoff Economy." People trade crowdfunding spots on Reddit and eBay. A static email screenshot is worthless for trust. Live Verify turns the **Pledge Receipt** into a transferable "Proof of Ownership" that can be verified by anyone, anywhere, without needing the original owner's password.
