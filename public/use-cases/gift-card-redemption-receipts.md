## What is a Gift Card Redemption Receipt?

A gift card redemption receipt confirms that stored value has been spent, transferred, or the card has been fully exhausted. These receipts prove that value was consumed as claimed, preventing disputes about remaining balances.

Gift card fraud is extensive: draining cards before legitimate use, fake balance claims, and redemption disputes. Verified receipts create an audit trail.

## Data Verified

Issuer name, card/voucher number (masked), original value, transaction details, amount used, remaining balance, redemption date, card status.

**Document Types:**
- **Gift Card Receipt:** Retail gift card used.
- **Prepaid Card Statement:** Reloadable prepaid card activity.
- **Travel Voucher:** Airline or hotel credit redeemed.
- **Store Credit:** Return credit applied to purchase.
- **Digital Wallet:** Closed-loop payment credit used.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`target.com`, `delta.com`) and card status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Exhausted** — Full value used, card has zero balance.
- **Active** — Card has remaining balance.
- **Expired** — Card expired with unused value (some jurisdictions require refund).
- **Blocked** — Card frozen due to fraud or dispute.
- **Refunded** — Unused value returned to purchaser.

## Second-Party Use

The **Cardholder** benefits from verification.

**Dispute Prevention:** When gift cards are disputed as "never received value," verified redemption receipts prove the card was used.

**Lost Card Claims:** If a card is reported lost but was already redeemed, verified receipts show when and where value was used.

**Balance Confirmation:** Cardholders can verify their balance history matches the issuer's records.

## Third-Party Use

**Retailers / Merchants**
**Fraud Investigation:** When investigating gift card fraud rings, verified redemption history traces the flow of value.

**Law Enforcement**
**Financial Crime:** Gift cards are used in money laundering and scam payment. Verified redemption trails support investigations.

**Corporate Purchasers**
**Employee Benefits:** Companies issuing gift cards as rewards need verified proof they were redeemed for tax and accounting purposes.

**Estate Executors**
**Asset Recovery:** When settling estates, executors need to verify what stored value remains and what was already spent.

## Verification Architecture

**The Gift Card Fraud Problem**

- **Card Draining:** Criminals copy card numbers in stores and drain them after activation.
- **Balance Disputes:** Claims that cards had value when they were already exhausted.
- **Fake Issuance:** Fraudulent gift cards sold that have no actual value.
- **Scam Payments:** Victims pay scammers in gift cards; redemption tracking supports recovery efforts.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Retailers:** (Target, Amazon, Starbucks, Home Depot).
**Networks:** (Visa, Mastercard prepaid programs).
**Airlines/Hotels:** Travel voucher issuers.
**Fintech:** (Green Dot, Netspend, PayPal) prepaid card issuers.

**Scam Recovery**

Law enforcement investigating gift card scams could verify redemption locations and times to trace criminal activity.

**Escheatment Compliance**

States require unclaimed gift card balances to be reported as unclaimed property. Verified redemption records prove value was used before escheatment.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Gift card issuers and merchants issue redemption receipts confirming the purchase and value consumed. Self-authorized by their control of the gift card balance system.

```
✓ giftcards.amazon.co.uk/verify — Issues gift card redemption receipts and transaction confirmations
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the gift card issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (card/voucher number, original value, transaction details, amount used, remaining balance, redemption date, card status) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the redemption receipt.
