## What is a Sanctions Screening Confirmation?

Before doing business with someone — opening an account, processing a payment, entering a contract — firms must check they're not on a sanctions list. The **screening confirmation** documents that this check was performed, when, against which lists, and the result.

If you do business with a sanctioned party, even accidentally, the penalties are severe (fines, criminal prosecution, reputational destruction). The screening confirmation proves you did your due diligence.

## Data Verified

**Screened party name**, **screening timestamp**, **reference number**, **lists checked** (with versions), **result** (no match / potential match / confirmed match), **screening provider**, **compliance officer sign-off**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Clear** — No matches at time of screening
- **Potential Match** — Review required (false positive evaluation)
- **Confirmed Match** — Party is on sanctions list (do not proceed)
- **Expired** — Screening too old, re-screening required
- **Superseded** — Party re-screened with updated result

## Why Continuous Screening Matters

Sanctions lists change constantly. Someone cleared today might be sanctioned tomorrow. Firms must:
- Screen at onboarding
- Re-screen periodically (daily for payments, quarterly for dormant relationships)
- Re-screen when lists update

A confirmation is a **point-in-time snapshot**. It proves you checked — but doesn't guarantee the party is still clear.

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Regulator | Primary Lists | Penalties |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **US** | OFAC (Treasury) | SDN, Sectoral Sanctions, CAPTA | Up to $1M per violation, criminal prosecution |
| **UK** | HMT, OFSI | UK Sanctions List, consolidated list | Unlimited fines, criminal liability |
| **EU** | European Commission | EU Consolidated List | National enforcement varies |
| **UN** | Security Council | UN Sanctions Lists | Member states must implement |

US OFAC applies extraterritorially — even non-US firms processing USD transactions must comply.

## Third-Party Use

**Correspondent banks** — Before processing payments through your institution
**Auditors** — Testing AML/sanctions program effectiveness
**Regulators** — Examinations, enforcement investigations
**Counterparties** — Due diligence before entering contracts
**Insurers** — Trade credit, political risk (sanctions compliance warranties)

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Firms claim they screened when they didn't
- Screening results are backdated after problems emerge
- Fabricated confirmations to satisfy audit requirements
- Disputes about what lists were checked and when

**The Fix:** Screening confirmation hashed at time of screening, with timestamp and list versions. Auditor or regulator can verify: this exact screening occurred at this exact time against these exact list versions. Can't be fabricated after the fact.

**Rescreening visibility:** When a party is re-screened, previous confirmations remain valid but show "Superseded" — the audit trail is preserved. If a re-screening reveals a match, the timeline is clear.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Authorized financial firms issue sanctions screening confirmations proving they checked clients against official sanctions lists.

```
✓ compliance.example-bank.co.uk/sanctions/verify — Authorized financial firm's compliance office
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK financial crime prevention
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## The False Positive Problem

Most "matches" are false positives — common names, similar spellings. The confirmation should document:
- Initial match result
- Review performed (who, when, rationale)
- Final determination (true match vs. false positive)

This review documentation is also verifiable — proving the firm didn't just ignore potential matches.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the financial firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (screened party name, screening timestamp, reference number, lists checked with versions) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the screening confirmation and an audit trail regulators can inspect.
