## What is a Proof of Delivery (POD)?

In the logistics industry, the **Proof of Delivery (POD)** is the legal evidence that a shipment was successfully handed over to the recipient. It acts as the "Off-Ramp" for liability: once the POD is signed, the carrier is typically no longer responsible for the goods.

Fraud is rampant in high-value shipping (electronics, pharmaceuticals). Dishonest receivers may claim **"Goods Never Received"** despite signing for them, or dishonest drivers may forge a signature to hide a theft or a late delivery. Verified hashes bind the **Tracking Number, Timestamp, and Recipient Name** to the carrier's domain, creating an indisputable audit trail.

## Data Verified

Waybill/Tracking number, carrier ID, consignee name, delivery address, quantity of items, condition status (Intact/Damaged), recipient signature (via hash), delivery photo (via hash), GPS coordinates of handoff, driver ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Electronic POD (ePOD):** Generated on the driver's handheld device.
- **Paper Delivery Receipt:** The traditional "Carbon Copy" signed at the dock.
- **Door-Drop Photo Proof:** For residential deliveries without signature.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dhl.com`, `fedex.com`, `maersk.com`) and the delivery standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Delivered** — Goods successfully handed over and signed for.
- **Refused** — Recipient rejected the shipment (e.g., due to damage).
- **Returned** — Goods back in carrier possession.
- **Contested** — **ALERT:** Recipient has filed a claim of non-delivery.

## Second-Party Use

The **Consignee (Receiver)** benefits from verification.

**Inventory Integrity:** A warehouse manager receiving 500 pallets can scan the driver's POD to ensure the "Quantity Received" digitally recorded matches what is on the paper before the driver leaves the site.

**Payment Authorization:** Accounts Payable departments use verified PODs as the "Trigger" to pay vendor invoices. A verified hash removes the 3-day delay of waiting for a scanned paper copy to arrive in the system.

## Third-Party Use

**Shippers (The Sender)**
**Revenue Recognition:** Under accounting rules (ASC 606), a company can't book revenue until delivery occurs. Verified PODs provide the "Audit-Proof" evidence needed for quarterly financial reporting.

**Insurance Underwriters**
**Claims Adjudication:** When a $50,000 server goes missing, the insurer scans the POD. If the hash returns **"DELIVERED - SIGNATURE VERIFIED,"** they can deny the claim and focus on internal theft at the destination.

**Customs Brokers**
**Import Clearance:** Proving to tax authorities that goods entered the country and were delivered to the registered importer, preventing "Diversion Fraud."

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Delivery" Fraud Problem**

- **Signature Forgery:** Drivers signing "John Doe" and keeping the goods.
- **Quantity Tampering:** A receiver changing "10 Boxes" to "8 Boxes" on the paper after the driver leaves to claim a shortage.
- **Backdating:** Changing the delivery date to avoid "Late Delivery" penalties in a service contract.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Logistics Integrators.**
**Local Last-Mile Couriers.**
**Internal Corporate Fleets.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Tracking numbers and addresses are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Tracking Number Harvesting" by data scrapers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Logistics carriers issue proof of delivery confirming shipment handoff to recipients. The issuer is self-authorized as the carrier responsible for delivery documentation.

```
✓ pod.fedex.com/verify — Issues verified delivery receipts with recipient signature and timestamp
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Proof of Delivery is the "Closing Link" in the global supply chain. Live Verify turns a fleeting physical event (the handoff) into a permanent, verifiable digital fact, reducing billions in "Loss and Dispute" costs annually.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (waybill number, delivery timestamp, consignee name, delivery address, condition status, recipient ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the delivery.
