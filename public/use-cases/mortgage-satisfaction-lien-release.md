## Data Verified

Mortgagor (Borrower) name, Mortgagee (Lender) name, original loan account number (masked), original mortgage date, original recording reference (Liber/Page/Doc #), property address, satisfaction date, Notary ID, issuing bank domain.

**Document Types:**
- **Satisfaction of Mortgage:** Standard for states using Mortgages.
- **Deed of Reconveyance:** For states using Deeds of Trust.
- **Lien Release Certificate:** For junior liens or HELOCs.
- **Paid-in-Full Letter:** Informal pre-recording proof.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`wellsfargo.com`, `chase.com`) and current recording status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Satisfied/Closed** — Loan is paid in full; lien is verified as released.
- **Recorded** — Official confirmation that the release reached the County Clerk.
- **Amended** — Original release had an error (e.g., wrong Liber/Page).
- **Void** — Assigned to wrong account or found to be fraudulent.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner (Ex-Borrower)** benefits from verification.

**Refinancing / Home Equity:** Proving to a new lender that the "Old $250,000 Mortgage" is verified as satisfied. This prevents the new loan from being blocked due to "Title Gaps" where the old bank forgot to mail the paper release to the county.

**Home Sale:** Providing a verified "Clear Title" status to a buyer's attorney during pre-closing due diligence, ensuring a smooth and fast closing without last-minute "Missing Lien" drama.

## Third-Party Use

**Real Estate Attorneys / Title Companies**
**Title Clearance:** Ensuring that the "Satisfaction Letter" provided by the seller isn't a fake PDF created to hide an active $500,000 debt. Live Verify connects the attorney directly to the lender's domain, stopping the most common form of "Title Fraud."

**County Recorders / Registrars**
**Fraud Prevention:** Verifying the authenticity of a satisfaction document *before* it is permanently recorded in the public land records.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Lien Priority:** Verifying that all senior liens have been legitimately discharged before funding a new 1st-position mortgage.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Satisfaction" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Releases:** Fraudsters using a bank's letterhead to create a fake "Lien Release" to steal a house they don't own (by "clearing" the debt so they can sell it to an unsuspecting buyer).
- **Incomplete Recording:** A bank issuing a "Satisfied" paper to the borrower but never actually filing the release with the county. Verification shows the *Status* isn't yet "Recorded."
- **Account Swapping:** Taking a valid release for a $10,000 loan and editing it to cover a $1,000,000 loan.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Banks & Credit Unions.**
**Mortgage Servicers:** (e.g., Mr. Cooper, Cenlar).
**Title Underwriters:** (Hosting verified hashes for historical closings).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Nationwide Building Society, a regulated lender, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified mortgage satisfaction and lien release documents.

```
✓ mortgage.nationwide.co.uk/release/verify — Issues verified mortgage satisfaction records
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK banks and deposit-takers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the lender's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (loan numbers, borrower identifiers, property addresses, satisfaction dates) — never financial account details — providing non-repudiation of lien release.

## Competition vs. County Land Records (GIS)

| Feature | Live Verify | County GIS / Online Search | Scanned PDF Release |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lender. | **Database.** High trust but manual. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the account #. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the paper. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires finding the parcel # and navigating old UIs. | **Instant.** |
| **Audit-ability** | **High.** Proves the bank's intent. | **Medium.** Only shows what was *filed*. | **None.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Lender Intent." County records only show what was *successfully filed*. If a bank issues a release but the courier loses it, the county record is "Dirty." Live Verify turns the **Physical Satisfaction Letter** into a live link back to the bank's system, proving the debt is dead even before the county's database catches up.
