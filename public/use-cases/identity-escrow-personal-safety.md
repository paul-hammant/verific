## What is Identity Escrow for Personal Safety?

When strangers meet in person, there's inherent risk. Identity escrow provides accountability without requiring parties to share personal details directly. A witnessing organization verifies both identities and holds them in escrow—disclosed only if something goes wrong.

This is a **notary for personal encounters**—creating a record that deters bad actors and provides recourse for victims.

## Derivation 1: Dating App First Meetups

**The Problem:**
Dating apps facilitate introductions but don't verify identities. "Catfishing" (fake identities) and assault are real risks. Victims often can't identify their attacker because they only knew a first name and a burner phone number.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="date"></span>SAFEMEET VERIFIED ENCOUNTER

Encounter ID: SM-2025-0114-4421
Date: January 14, 2025, 7:00 PM EST
Location Type: Restaurant / Public Venue

PARTY A: Verified Identity #A-881234
PARTY B: Verified Identity #B-229847

Both parties have verified their identity via
government ID. Neither party has access to the
other's personal information.

In case of emergency or incident, contact:
SafeMeet Trust & Safety: safety@safemeet.org

<span data-verify-line="date">verify:safemeet.org/encounters/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="date"></span></pre>
</div>

**Data Flow:**
1. Both parties verify identity through the dating app's partner (e.g., SafeMeet)
2. Each receives a verified encounter record before meeting
3. Neither sees the other's real name, address, or phone
4. If an incident occurs, law enforcement can request identity disclosure

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Both parties verified; encounter logged
- **Incident Reported** — One party filed a safety report
- **Under Investigation** — Law enforcement has requested records
- **Resolved** — Investigation closed

**Second-Party Use:**
- **Peace of mind:** "If something happens, there's a record"
- **Deterrence:** Bad actors know their identity is on file
- **Emergency contact:** Witness org can contact emergency services if party doesn't check in

**Third-Party Use:**
- **Law enforcement:** Subpoena for identity after assault report
- **Dating platforms:** Aggregate safety metrics (anonymized) to identify risky patterns

## Derivation 2: Roommate Matching

**The Problem:**
Finding a roommate through Craigslist or Facebook means living with a stranger. Background checks are expensive and awkward to request. If a roommate skips out on rent or steals belongings, you may have no way to find them.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

Both prospective roommates verify identity with a witnessing org before signing the lease. Neither needs to share personal details until they've decided to move forward.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="room"></span>ROOMMATE MATCH VERIFICATION

Match ID: RM-2025-0114-7721
Verified: January 14, 2025

TENANT A: Verified Identity #T-449281
  - Government ID verified
  - No eviction records found (public records)

TENANT B: Verified Identity #T-882134
  - Government ID verified
  - No eviction records found (public records)

Both parties may proceed to lease signing.
Full names released upon mutual consent.

<span data-verify-line="room">verify:roomverify.org/match/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="room"></span></pre>
</div>

**What Gets Checked:**

- Public eviction records (optional)
- Public criminal records (optional, with consent)

**What Gets Escrowed:**
- Full legal name and address
- Contact information
- ID document reference

**Disclosure Triggers:**
- Mutual consent (both agree to share)
- Lease dispute filed with landlord/court
- Criminal complaint filed

**Second-Party Use:**
- **Pre-lease confidence:** Know you're not moving in with someone using a fake identity
- **Post-move recourse:** If they vanish owing rent, you can find them

**Third-Party Use:**
- **Landlords:** Verify both tenants went through identity verification
- **Small claims courts:** Obtain identity for service of process

## Derivation 3: Child Custody Exchanges

**The Problem:**
High-conflict custody situations require neutral, documented exchanges. Parents may dispute what time the child was dropped off, whether the child was properly dressed, or whether the other parent was intoxicated. Current solutions (police station parking lots, supervised visitation centers) are stigmatizing and inconvenient.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

A witnessing service documents the exchange with verified identities, timestamps, and optional condition notes.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="cust"></span>CUSTODY EXCHANGE RECORD

Exchange ID: CX-2025-0114-1192
Date: January 14, 2025, 6:00 PM EST
Location: SafeExchange Center, Austin TX

DELIVERING PARENT: Verified Identity #P-449281
RECEIVING PARENT: Verified Identity #P-882134
CHILD: [Name redacted], DOB [redacted]

Delivery Time: 6:02 PM (2 minutes late)
Child Condition: Well-dressed, good spirits
Notes: None

Both parents verified via government ID.

<span data-verify-line="cust">verify:safeexchange.org/custody/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="cust"></span></pre>
</div>

**What Gets Recorded:**
- Verified identities of both parents
- Exact timestamp of exchange
- Optional condition notes (clothing, mood, visible injuries)

- Ongoing custody dispute details

**Status Indications:**
- **Completed** — Exchange occurred as scheduled
- **Late Delivery** — Delivering parent arrived after scheduled time
- **No Show** — One parent did not appear
- **Incident** — Dispute or concerning behavior noted

**Second-Party Use:**
- **Court evidence:** Verified record of on-time exchanges
- **Pattern documentation:** Consistent late deliveries become evidence
- **Peace of mind:** Less "he said/she said" conflict

**Third-Party Use:**
- **Family courts:** Verified exchange records as evidence
- **Guardian ad litem:** Pattern analysis of exchange compliance
- **Mediators:** Objective data for dispute resolution

## Derivation 4: Informal Caregiving Arrangements

**The Problem:**
Hiring a babysitter, dog walker, or elderly caregiver through personal referrals or Nextdoor means trusting someone in your home with vulnerable family members. Professional services have background checks; informal arrangements don't.

**How Identity Escrow Helps:**

Before the first visit, both parties verify identity with a witnessing org. The caregiver's identity is escrowed; if anything goes wrong (theft, neglect, injury), there's accountability.

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #fff; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
  <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.85em; white-space: pre; color: #000; line-height: 1.6;"><span verifiable-text="start" data-for="care"></span>CAREGIVER IDENTITY VERIFICATION

## Verification Architecture

**The "Stranger Danger" Problem:**

All four derivations share a common pattern:
- Two parties need to interact in person
- Neither wants to share personal details upfront
- Post-interaction accountability might be needed
- Traditional verification (licenses, employers) doesn't apply

**What Identity Escrow Provides:**

| Without Escrow | With Escrow |
| :--- | :--- |
| First name and phone only | Verified government ID on file |
| No recourse if they vanish | Contact relay through witness |
| "He said / she said" disputes | Timestamped, verified records |
| Victims can't identify attacker | Law enforcement can obtain identity |

**What the Witness is NOT:**

- **Not a matchmaker** — Doesn't facilitate introductions
- **Not a background check service** — May include optional checks, but core value is identity escrow
- **Not law enforcement** — Discloses only with proper process
- **Not a guarantor** — Doesn't insure against bad outcomes

**Identity Escrow vs. Professional Credential Verification:**

This is distinct from verifying licensed professionals (plumbers, electricians, healthcare workers). See `home-service-provider-verification.md` for that pattern.

| Aspect | Identity Escrow | Professional Credentials |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Who's verified | Any individual (stranger) | Licensed professional |
| Trust anchor | Third-party escrow org | Licensing board / employer |
| What's verified | "This is a real person" | "This person is qualified to do X" |
| Ongoing relationship | Often one-time or short-term | May be ongoing professional |
| Background check | Optional add-on | Usually required by license |
| Disclosure trigger | Incident / legal process | Public (license is public record) |
| Use case | Dating, roommates, P2P sales | Plumber at your door, nurse in hospital |

**Privacy Architecture:**

- Identities stored encrypted, access-logged
- No bulk disclosure possible
- Disclosure requires legal process OR mutual consent
- Witness cannot monetize identity data

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Personal

An escrow provider (third party) holds verified identities on behalf of individuals meeting for personal encounters. The escrow holds identity on consent, releasing only if needed for legal process.

```
✓ safety.example-escrow.com/verify — Verifies individual identity for personal encounters; releases only with consent or legal order
```

Personal issuer — individual attestation, no regulatory chain.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the escrow provider's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (disclosure dates, authorized parties, consent records) — never sensitive personal information or identity details — providing non-repudiation of identity release events.
