## What is a Legal Name Change Document?

A **Legal Name Change Document** is the official proof that a person has lawfully changed their name outside of marriage or divorce. This covers voluntary name changes for personal, cultural, religious, or professional reasons.

These documents are the "Before and After" bridge for identity. Fraud is common: individuals create fake name change documents to evade debts, criminal records, or court orders. Verified hashes bind the **Previous Name, New Name, Date of Change, and Issuing Authority** to the official registry's domain.

## Terminology by Jurisdiction

|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **England & Wales** | Deed Poll (enrolled or unenrolled) | Self-executed; enrolled via HM Courts |
| **Scotland** | Statutory Declaration | Solicitor or Notary Public |
| **Northern Ireland** | Deed Poll | Self-executed; enrolled via courts |
| **Ireland** | Deed Poll | Self-executed; can be filed with courts |
| **United States** | Court Order for Name Change | State/County Court (varies by state) |
| **Canada** | Legal Change of Name Certificate | Provincial Vital Statistics Office |
| **Australia** | Change of Name Certificate | State/Territory Registry of Births, Deaths & Marriages |
| **New Zealand** | Deed Poll / Statutory Declaration | Self-executed or via court |
| **Germany** | Namensänderungsurkunde | Standesamt (Civil Registry Office) |
| **France** | Jugement de changement de nom | Tribunal judiciaire |
| **Netherlands** | Besluit naamswijziging | Koninklijk besluit (Royal Decree) for surname; gemeente for first name |
| **India** | Gazette Notification / Affidavit | State Gazette + newspaper publication |
| **South Africa** | Amendment of Forenames/Surname | Department of Home Affairs |
| **Singapore** | Deed Poll | Singapore Legal Advice / lawyer-executed |

## Enrolled vs. Unenrolled (UK)

In England and Wales, a distinction exists:

**Unenrolled Deed Poll:**
- Self-executed document
- Legally valid for most purposes
- No central registry
- Cannot be verified against government systems
- Accepted by most banks, DVLA, HMRC, passport office

**Enrolled Deed Poll:**
- Filed with the Royal Courts of Justice
- Published in The Gazette (public record)
- Searchable in perpetuity
- Verifiable against court records
- Required for some official purposes

The verification advantage of enrolled deeds is clear: a `verify:` line pointing to `gov.uk` provides cryptographic proof the name change is registered with the courts.

## Data Verified

Previous full name, new full name, date of name change, date of enrolment/registration, enrolment/certificate number, issuing authority, jurisdiction.

**Document Types:**
- **Deed Poll (UK/Ireland/HK/SG/NZ):** Self-declaration of name change
- **Court Order (US/Japan/Korea/Philippines):** Judicially approved name change
- **Registry Certificate (Canada/Australia/Germany):** Government-issued certificate
- **Gazette Notification (India):** Published in official gazette
- **Statutory Declaration (Scotland/NZ):** Sworn statement before authorized witness

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Hash matches, name change is registered
- **EXPIRED** — N/A (name changes don't expire)
- **REVOKED** — Name change was legally reversed (rare)
- **404** — Hash not found (OCR error, or document not in system)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` URL in the document itself (e.g., `gov.uk`, `ontario.ca`, `nsw.gov.au`).

## First-Party Use

The **Issuing Authority** (courts, registries, civil offices) benefits from verification.

**Reduced Certificate Fraud:** Courts and registries regularly receive reports of forged name change documents. Verification endpoints allow any relying party to check authenticity instantly, reducing the burden on registry staff handling "is this real?" phone calls.

**Cross-Border Cooperation:** When foreign authorities query the legitimacy of a name change, the issuing registry can point them to the public verification endpoint rather than engaging in slow diplomatic channels or apostille processes.

**Audit Trail:** The registry maintains a log of verification requests, providing insight into which documents are being actively used and potentially flagging suspicious patterns (e.g., the same document verified hundreds of times from different locations).

## Second-Party Use

The **Individual Who Changed Their Name** benefits from verification.

**Proving Continuity of Identity:** When applying for jobs, opening bank accounts, or signing contracts, the individual can provide their verified name change document. Employers and institutions can instantly confirm the name change is legitimate, not a forged document.

**Historical Record Access:** Accessing old records (academic transcripts, medical history, employment references) under a former name requires proving the link. A verified name change document provides that bridge.

**International Recognition:** When emigrating or working abroad, foreign authorities may question whether a name change document is genuine. Verification against the issuing country's domain provides cross-border assurance.

## Third-Party Use

**Banks / Financial Institutions (KYC Compliance)**
**Anti-Money Laundering:** Name changes are a known vector for identity fraud and money laundering. Verified name change documents ensure the customer's identity trail is legitimate and auditable.

**Employers / HR Departments**
**Background Check Continuity:** When criminal background checks or reference checks span a name change, HR needs to verify the name change is real. This prevents candidates from hiding adverse history under a "new" identity.

**Immigration Authorities**
**Visa Application Integrity:** Applicants who have changed names must prove the change was legal. Verification prevents fraudulent name changes designed to evade immigration restrictions or criminal records.

**Landlords / Letting Agents**
**Tenant Verification:** Prospective tenants presenting references or credit history under a different name need to prove the connection. Verified name change documents prevent identity substitution fraud.

**Educational Institutions**
**Transcript Reissuance:** Alumni requesting transcripts under a new name must prove they are the same person. Verification ensures the institution updates records for the correct individual.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Identity Discontinuity" Problem**

- **Debt Evasion:** Creating a fake name change to escape CCJs, bankruptcies, or outstanding loans
- **Criminal Record Hiding:** Fabricating a name change to pass background checks
- **Qualification Fraud:** Claiming someone else's credentials by "proving" a name change from their name to yours
- **Multiple Identity Fraud:** Maintaining parallel identities for fraudulent purposes

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Government Courts and Registries:** HM Courts, US state courts, Canadian provincial vital statistics
**Civil Registry Offices:** German Standesamt, French tribunal judiciaire, Brazilian cartório
**Official Gazettes:** India Gazette, The Gazette (UK)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. The combination of previous name + new name + date is sensitive PII. The hash must be salted to prevent enumeration attacks revealing who has changed their name.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

UK courts issue legal name change orders under the Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994.

```
✓ courts.gov.uk/namechange/verify — UK courts legal name change orders and enrolments
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the court or vital records agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the name change document.

## Why Not Just Show ID?

A passport or driver's license shows your *current* name. It doesn't prove you were ever called something else. When the question is "prove you used to be James Thompson," showing ID that says "James Wilson" doesn't help.

The name change document is the **bridge document**—it connects the before and after. Verification ensures that bridge is genuine, not fabricated to create a false identity history.
