## What is a Ballot Transfer Form?

In an election, ballots are often driven from a local school (polling place) to a central counting facility. During that drive, the ballots are in a "Black Box" of risk.

The **Chain-of-Custody Form** is the paper that follows the box. It lists:
1.  **The Count:** "There are exactly 1,242 ballots in this box."
2.  **The Seal:** "The box is locked with Seal #AZ-009988."
3.  **The Witnesses:** Two people (one from each party) must sign it.

If a box arrives at the counting center with a different count or seal than what is on the verified form, the alarm is raised immediately.

## Data Verified

Precinct number, Container ID, Seal Number (unique plastic/wire seal), ballot count (from machine or hand count), names of two bipartisan witnesses/custodians, precise timestamp, transfer location.

**Document Types:**
- **Transfer Log:** Used during transport from precinct to tabulation.
- **Drop Box Retrieval Form:** Documenting the 2-person pickup from ballot drop boxes.
- **Tabulation Intake Form:** Final receipt at the central counting facility.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`maricopa.gov`, `miamidade.gov`) and the transfer status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Logged** — Origin precinct has recorded the transfer.
- **In-Transit** — Transport team has confirmed possession.
- **Received** — Central counting has verified the seal and count.
- **Seal Mismatch** — **ALERT:** Intake count or seal number does not match origin record.

## Second-Party Use

The **Election Official/Poll Worker** (second party) receives the transfer form from the county election department (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The poll worker has their own verified copy of the ballot transfer. Most of the time, the document sits in election records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The poll worker can confirm at any time that the form matches what the county's system recorded and hasn't been altered since they completed it.

**Future Optionality:** If a recount occurs, an election challenge arises, or a legal dispute emerges about chain-of-custody, the poll worker has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the county election office.

## Third-Party Use

The election official/poll worker (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Election Observers / Challengers**
Political party observers can scan the transfer forms as containers arrive at the central facility. Verification ensures the forms weren't "swapped" or "re-written" during the drive.

**Media / Journalists**
Fact-checking claims of "mysterious boxes appearing." Verified chain-of-custody proves where every box came from and when it was logged.

**The Courts**
In an election contest, verified custody forms provide a cryptographically solid audit trail that is harder to challenge than mere photocopies.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ballot Box" Fraud Problem**

- **Box Substitution:** Swapping a box of real ballots for a box of fake ballots during transport. The seal numbers won't match the verified origin record.
- **Count Inflation:** Changing the count on the paper form from 1,000 to 1,200 to hide extra ballots.
- **Fabricated Transfers:** Creating a fake transfer form for a non-existent precinct.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- County Election Departments — The primary authorities
- Secretary of State — Overseeing the state-wide standards

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Ballot transfer forms contain enumerable values—predictable precinct numbers, sequential container IDs, standard seal number formats, and round ballot counts. A malicious actor could feasibly enumerate combinations to monitor or reverse-engineer ballot movement patterns across a jurisdiction. Salt protects the integrity and privacy of election logistics.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Administers election ballot custody and transfer records.

```
✓ elections.maryland.gov/verify — Administers election ballot custody and transfer records
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the county's hashes and status changes (in-transit, received, seal mismatch) plus structured metadata (precinct numbers, container IDs, seal numbers, ballot counts, timestamps) — never poll worker names or non-public addresses — providing non-repudiation of the transfer form and an audit trail state election oversight can inspect for chain-of-custody violations.

## Competition vs. Central Portals / GPS

| Feature | Live Verify | Internal Election Portal | GPS Tracking on Trucks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Observer Access** | **High.** External parties can verify without system access. | **Zero.** Observers are never given logins to sensitive gov systems. | **None.** Proves where the truck went, not what's in the box. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *count* and *seal* numbers. | **Vulnerable.** Internal DB can be edited by admins. | **N/A.** |
| **Offline Proof** | **Strong.** Paper form works if the counting center Wi-Fi is jammed. | **None.** | **Weak.** Requires cell signal. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Trust through Decentralization. In a polarized election, the "Opposition" does not trust the government's internal database. Live Verify allows the opposition to verify the paper records against a public-facing domain without needing "Super-User" access to the voting system, creating a bipartisan trust bridge.
