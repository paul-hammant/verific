## What is a Food Safety Audit?

Before a company like Costco or Walmart will buy frozen pizza or canned soup from a factory, they require an independent **Food Safety Audit** (like SQF or BRCGS).

An auditor visits the factory to verify that the floors are clean, the machines are sanitized, and the workers follow hygiene rules. The result is a **Certificate of Registration**.

This certificate is the "License to Sell" to big retailers. Shady factories that fail their audit sometimes "Photoshop" a passing certificate to trick buyers. Verified hashes allow a retail buyer to see the **un-altered audit score** on the standard body's domain.

## Data Verified

Facility name, premises address, certification standard (e.g., SQF, BRCGS, HACCP), audit score/rating, scope of certification (e.g., "Dairy" vs "Dry Goods"), certification body name, issuance date, expiration date, serial number.

### Scope enrichment: what the certificate actually covers

The headline fraud here is *scope misrepresentation* — using a certificate for "Dry Legumes" to sell
"High-Risk Prepared Salads." A food-safety certificate carries no personal data, so on verification the
certification body can safely **echo the certified scope and freshness** — the exact
`certified_scope` (e.g. "Processing of Perishable Prepared Foods (Ready-to-Eat)"), the `audit_date`,
and the `recertification_due`. A buyer then sees the *actual* scope of the certificate rather than a
broadened label, and cannot read a dry-goods certificate as covering high-risk prepared foods; and a
certificate past its audit window reads as stale. Safe enrichment — no personal data, revealing the
scope and freshness the terse claim withheld (see
[safety-certifications](safety-certifications.md) and
[verification-enrichment-hazards.md](../../docs/verification-enrichment-hazards.md)).

**Document Types:**
- **GFSI Audit Certificate:** The gold standard for global manufacturing.
- **Organic Integrity Certificate:** Proving USDA/EU Organic status.
- **Kosher / Halal Certification:** Proving religious dietary compliance.
- **Pesticide-Free Attestation:** (Linked hash) from a 3rd party lab.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Facility passed audit and is in good standing
- **SUSPENDED** — Critical safety failure detected; certification paused; do not source from this facility
- **REVOKED** — Certificate voided due to fraud or systemic contamination
- **EXPIRED** — Re-audit overdue; certification no longer valid
- **404** — Certificate not found (never issued, wrong facility, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the certificate itself (e.g., `sqfi.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

None typically. The verification confirms the facility's certification status; that's the value for procurement teams and supply chain audits.

**Why No Further Action:**

- **Retail procurement** just needs the status code to approve or flag a supplier
- **Insurance underwriters** just need to confirm the audit rating for pricing
- **Supply chain platforms** just need pass/fail for automated compliance checks

If there's a problem (SUSPENDED, REVOKED), the action is clear: don't source from the facility, find an alternative supplier. No POST form needed.

**For Food Safety Incidents:**

If a verifier discovers contamination or suspects certificate fraud, the report goes to:
- The certification body (SQF, BRCGS)
- FDA or local health authority
- Not through a verification endpoint — these are regulatory enforcement matters

## Second-Party Use

The **Manufacturer / Processor** benefits from verification.

**Retailer Onboarding:** Proving to a major retailer (e.g., Costco or Whole Foods) that the facility meets their "Tier 1 Food Safety" requirements. A verified hash from the standard body domain prevents the 2-week delay of manual audit verification.

**Brand Protection:** Displaying the "Verified SQF" badge on B2B marketing materials, ensuring that potential partners trust the facility's hygiene standards without needing a physical site-visit.

## Third-Party Use

**Retail Procurement Teams**
**Supply Chain Integrity:** Instantly verifying the safety certificates of 500+ suppliers. Live Verify allows procurement platforms to automatically flag suppliers with "Suspended" or "Expired" certificates, preventing contaminated food from reaching store shelves.

**Consumers (Labels)**
**Trust Check:** Scanning a QR code on a pack of "Verified Halal" or "Verified Organic" food. "Verified by OU Kosher" provides instant, cryptographic assurance that the label isn't just a marketing fabrication.

**Insurance Companies**
**Recall Coverage:** Underwriters verify food safety scores to price "Product Recall" policies. A verified 98/100 rating leads to lower premiums than an unverified "Pass."

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dirty Secret" Fraud Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** A facility that failed its audit creating a fake "Passing" PDF to keep their contract with a major retailer.
- **Scope Misrepresentation:** Taking a certificate for "Dry Legumes" and using it to sell "High-Risk Prepared Salads" to trick a buyer.
- **Status Concealment:** Hiding that a certificate was "Suspended" yesterday after an E. coli outbreak.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Scheme Owners:** (SQF Institute, BRCGS, FSSC 22000).
**Certification Bodies:** (SCS Global, NSF International).
**National Agriculture Depts:** (USDA, EU Commissions).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

```
✓ hygiene.example-restaurant.co.uk/verify — Prepares and serves food to the public
  ✓ food.gov.uk — Regulates food safety and hygiene standards in the UK
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the certification body's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (facility name, facility location, audit scope, audit rating, certification code edition, audit date, expiration date, auditor firm name) — never plaintext food process details — providing non-repudiation of the food safety certification.


## Competition vs. Private Portals (ReposiTrak)

| Feature | Live Verify | Supplier Portals (ReposiTrak) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any retailer/buyer can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires all parties to pay for the portal. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Auditor. | **System-Bound.** Trust the portal vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Works across 100+ different cert bodies. | **Low.** Hard to export "Trust" to other systems. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the audit score. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Supply Chain Web." A manufacturer might have 10 different customers, each using a different compliance portal. Live Verify turns the **Standard PDF Certificate** into a "Universal Trust Link" that works across every portal, every app, and every border without redundant manual entry.
