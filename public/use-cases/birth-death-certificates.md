## What is a Vital Record?

**Birth and Death Certificates** are the "Breeding Documents" of identity. Almost every other ID (Passport, Driver's License, Social Security Card) is issued based on a Birth Certificate.

Because they are so powerful, they are the #1 target for identity thieves. A criminal can use the birth certificate of a child who died young to "become" that person, opening bank accounts and taking out loans.

The strongest architecture is still the issuing vital-records office or the formal government verification channel where one exists. Live Verify is more credible when the certificate itself is the artifact in hand and the verifier needs a practical path back to current record status outside that government workflow.

## Data Verified

Full name at birth, date of birth, place of birth (City/County/State), parents' full names (including maiden), sex, file/registration number, date of registration, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Standard Birth Certificate:** Long or short form.
- **Death Certificate:** Including date/place of death and social security number.
- **Stillbirth Certificate:** (Certificate of Birth Resulting in Stillbirth).
- **Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA):** For citizens born overseas.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`health.pa.gov`, `cdc.gov`) and current record status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Record matches the vital statistics database.
- **Amended** — Original record was legally changed (e.g., adoption or name change).
- **Deceased** — (For Birth Certs) Cross-referenced with death registry to prevent "Ghost" identity theft.
- **Invalid** — File number mismatch or known fraudulent document series.

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Person** or **Next of Kin** benefits from verification.

**Passport Applications:** The issuing authority's own government verification channel should remain primary. The complementary case is when the certificate itself is what is circulating and the verifier needs a direct bridge back to issuer status.

**Real ID Licensing:** Speeding up checks when staff are working from the certificate and unclear paper quality is the immediate problem, not replacing the underlying government lookup.

**Estate Settlement:** Proving to a bank or life insurer that a family member has indeed passed away using a verified death certificate.

## Third-Party Use

**The State Department (Passport Agency)**
**Identity Integrity:** Passport fraud is often built on stolen or fake birth certificates. Verification directly against the issuing state's domain stops "Paper Forgery" cold.

**Banks and Lenders**
**KYC/Onboarding:** Using the birth certificate as a foundational "Breeding Document" for identity. Verification prevents fraudsters from using deceased persons' identities to open lines of credit.

**Genealogists / Historians**
**Record Accuracy:** Ensuring that historical records being used for lineage research are authentic government-issued documents.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Breeding Document" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghosting:** Using the birth certificate of a child who died young to assume their identity. Verification catches this by showing a "DECEASED" flag on the birth record.
- **Alteration:** Changing the date of birth to appear younger (for sports/schools) or older (for retirement benefits).
- **Fictitious Records:** Creating a realistic birth certificate for a non-existent person to get a "real" ID.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Departments of Health:** (Managing Vital Statistics).
**County Clerks:** (In some jurisdictions).
**Embassies/Consulates:** (For CRBA).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Vital records are protected by law. The hash must be salted to prevent enumeration/guessing of birth records.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

```
✓ gro.gov.uk/verify — Registers births, deaths, and marriages in England and Wales
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Physical Security (Paper)

| Feature | Live Verify | Security Paper (Intaglio/Void) | EVVE (Gov-to-Gov) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects the *text*. | **Mechanical.** Protects the *paper*. | **Database.** Direct server check. |
| **Public Access** | **Useful when the certificate is the artifact being shared.** | **Visual.** Anyone can look at it. | **Primary for government channels.** |
| **Interoperability** | **Potentially high outside gov-only systems.** | **Low.** Requires expert knowledge of 50 different state paper types. | **None.** Private Gov-only network. |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** Specialty printing and chemical paper. | **High.** Per-query fees are common. |

**Narrower conclusion:** Government channels should remain primary where they exist and are usable. Live Verify is strongest only for private-sector and cross-jurisdiction workflows where the certificate itself is being presented outside those channels and the verifier otherwise falls back to paper inspection.
