## What is a Customs Invoice?

When goods cross an international border, the most important document is the **Commercial Invoice**. It is the formal bill from the seller to the buyer, but it also acts as the primary "Declaration of Value" for the government.

Customs officers use this invoice to decide:
1.  **HS Classification:** What is the product? (e.g., "Integrated Circuit").
2.  **Valuation:** What is it worth? (e.g., "$50,000").
3.  **Duty/Tax:** How much tax is owed? (e.g., 5% of value).

**"Under-valuation"** is a massive global trade crime. Shady importers often have the exporter send two invoices: a "Real" one for payment, and a "Fake" one with a 90% discount to show Customs. This allows them to evade millions in import duties. **"Tariff Engineering"** is another risk, where the HS code is edited on the paper to a low-duty category. Verified hashes bind the **Exporters' ledger value and the HS Code** to the manufacturer's or the trade platform's domain.

## Data Verified

Exporter/Seller name, Importer/Buyer name, Invoice number, Line-item descriptions, HS Codes, Unit/Total values, Currency (e.g., USD), Incoterms, Country of Origin, Date of issuance, Container/Reference number.

**Document Types:**
- **Commercial Invoice:** The primary document for customs and payment.
- **Pro Forma Invoice:** For pre-shipment clearance or deposits.
- **Consular Invoice:** Verified by a destination embassy.
- **Credit Memo:** (Linked hash) proving a reduction in value for damaged goods.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Exporter or their ERP system) and current invoice status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Content matches the exporter's official accounts receivable.
- **Paid** — Funds have been received (anti-money laundering proof).
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Transaction voided; invoice is invalid for customs entry.
- **Amended** — A revised invoice exists (linked hash to latest price correction).

## Second-Party Use

The **Importer (Buyer)** benefits from verification.

**Customs Defense:** Proving to Swiss or US Customs that the $57,500 value isn't a "Fake Low Value" to evade taxes. A verified invoice from the exporter's domain makes it impossible for Customs to accuse the importer of "Valuation Fraud" without challenging the exporter directly.

**Trade Financing:** Providing a verified invoice to a bank to secure a Letter of Credit or to authorize a large international wire transfer.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs Authorities (CBP / HMRC / Zoll)**
**Enforcement:** Customs sees millions of invoices daily. Live Verify allows an officer to verify the invoice against the exporter's domain in 5 seconds, catching "Double Invoicing" where high-tariff goods are mislabeled or under-valued on the paper document.

**Lenders and Factoring Firms**
**Asset Verification:** Verifying the "Account Receivable" value of an invoice before lending against it, stopping "Invoicing Fraud" in trade finance.

**Tax Auditors**
**VAT / GST Reconciliation:** Ensuring that the "Export Value" reported by the shipper matches the "Import Value" reported by the buyer across international borders.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Double Invoice" Fraud Problem**

- **Value Stripping:** Editing a $100,000 invoice to read $10,000 to save $20,000 in duties.
- **Code Engineering:** Changing the HS code for "Luxury Goods" to "Basic Materials."
- **Phantom Invoices:** Creating a fake invoice to justify an international wire used for money laundering.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Exporting Manufacturers:** (Primary source of truth).
**Customs Brokers:** (Managing verification for their clients).
**Trade Platforms:** (e.g., Flexport, Tradeshift, SAP Ariba).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Exporters issue commercial invoices as the source of truth for international trade. Self-authorized by their sale of goods and obligation to declare accurate values to customs authorities.

```
✓ trade.example-exporter.co.uk/invoice/verify — Issues commercial invoices and customs declarations
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the exporter's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (invoice number, HS codes, invoice value, country of origin, date of issuance) — never exporter/importer names or commercial terms — providing non-repudiation of the commercial invoice issuance.

## Competition vs. Customs Single Windows (ACE)

| Feature | Live Verify | ACE Portal (Gov) | Private EDI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Exporter. | **Gov-Bound.** Trust the filing. | **Network-Bound.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds line items.** Protects prices. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect paper. | **High.** |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any trucker/bank can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires Gov credentials. | **Siloed.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows "Cancelled" status. | **Laggy.** Updates take 24-48 hours. | **Live.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Source of Truth." Government databases only know what was *filed*. If the importer files a fake document, the government database reflects the fake. Live Verify links the verifier back to the **Exporter's accounting ledger**, ensuring the data matches the actual financial transaction.
