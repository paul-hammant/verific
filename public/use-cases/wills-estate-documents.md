## What is a Will?

A **Last Will and Testament** is the final legal declaration of a person's wishes regarding the distribution of their property after death. It is the "Moral and Legal anchor" of an estate.

It defines:
1.  **Beneficiaries:** Who gets the money, the house, and the family heirlooms.
2.  **Guardianship:** Who will raise any surviving minor children.
3.  **The Executor:** The trusted person who will manage the "Probate" process.

**"Will Tampering"** is a common and high-stakes fraud. Because wills are often multi-page documents held together by a simple staple, criminals (or disgruntled family members) use **"Page Substitution"**—they remove a single middle page and replace it with a forged one that changes a $10,000 bequest into a $100,000 one. Live Verify provides **Per-Page Verification**, binding the specific text of every page to the law firm's or the state will registry's domain.

## Data Verified

Testator name, Date of Execution, Witness names, Executor/Personal Representative name, Page Number (e.g., "Page 1 of 12"), Revision ID, Law firm/Attorney ID, Drafting date.

**Document Types:**
- **Last Will and Testament:** The primary testamentary document.
- **Codicil:** A formal amendment to an existing Will (linked hash).
- **Pour-Over Will:** Used in conjunction with a Living Trust.
- **Self-Proving Affidavit:** Notarized proof that the witnesses saw the signing.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Drafting Attorney or a State Will Registry) and the document standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid/Latest** — This is the most recent version of the Will known to the issuer.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer Will or Codicil has been issued (linked hash).
- **Revoked** — The Testator has explicitly cancelled this Will.
- **Admitted to Probate** — Document has been verified and accepted by a court.

## Second-Party Use

The **Testator (Principal)** benefits from verification.

**Safe Keeping:** Ensuring that the version of the Will they leave in their safe deposit box is "Verified Current." If they update their Will 5 years later, the verification status of the old paper Will instantly changes to "Superseded," preventing their family from accidentally probating the wrong document.

**Estate Review:** During an annual checkup with their lawyer, scanning the hash to confirm the document in their hand matches the lawyer's "Master File."

## Third-Party Use

**Probate Attorneys**
**Integrity Checks:** Before filing a Will with the court, the lawyer scans every page. "Verified by Drafting-Firm.com" ensures that no pages were swapped or "edited" by a beneficiary during the years the Will sat in a home safe.

**Probate Court Clerks**
**Admission Speed:** Instantly verifying the authenticity of a Will submitted for probate. This reduces the need for "Witness Testimony" to prove the Will is real, potentially saving the estate thousands in legal fees.

**Executor (Banker/Accountant)**
**Due Diligence:** Confirming they are following the **Latest Verified Instructions** before they begin the high-liability work of distributing assets.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Staple and Swap" Fraud Problem**

- **Page Substitution:** Removing a page that gives a house to "Charity A" and replacing it with a fake page that gives the house to "Son B."
- **Will Suppression:** Hiding a new Will to ensure an older, more favorable Will is used. Live Verify shows the old Will as "Superseded" when scanned, enabling detection if a verifier checks.
- **Codicil Forgery:** Creating a fake 1-page "Amendment" that changes the Executor to a fraudster.

**The "Mortal Witness" Attack — Undue Influence with Disposable Witnesses**

The most insidious will fraud is not document tampering — it is a legitimately drafted will produced under coercion, with witnesses chosen to be unavailable by the time it matters.

The attack pattern:
1. A family member or carer gains influence over an elderly testator — isolation, dependency, emotional manipulation
2. They arrange for a new will to be drafted by a real solicitor (or a complicit one), redirecting assets to themselves
3. The witnesses are deliberately chosen because they are also elderly, ill, or otherwise unlikely to survive long enough to testify at a probate contest — a neighbour with terminal cancer, a care home resident with dementia, an elderly friend who "won't be around much longer"
4. The testator dies. The will is probated. By the time other family members contest it, the witnesses are dead or cognitively unable to testify about the testator's state of mind or the circumstances of signing
5. The will's hash **verifies perfectly** against the solicitor's domain — this is issuer-side fraud, not document tampering. Live Verify cannot distinguish a coerced-but-genuine will from a freely-given one

**What Live Verify cannot do here:** Verification proves the solicitor attested to this document. It does not prove the testator was of sound mind, acting freely, or not under undue influence. A cryptographically valid will can still be a product of coercion.

**What Live Verify can contribute: independently verifiable witness attestations.**

If each witness's attestation is published as a **separate verifiable claim** on the solicitor's domain, the attestation survives the witness:

```
I, DOROTHY HELEN MARSH, witnessed MARGARET A. WILLOWS
sign her Last Will and Testament on 15 March 2026 at the
offices of Willows Law, 14 High Street, Chester.
The testator appeared to be of sound mind, was not under
visible duress, and signed voluntarily in my presence.
verify:willows-law.com/wills/v
```

This creates several defences:

- **The attestation exists as a timestamped record even after the witness dies.** The witness's words — including their assessment of the testator's mental state — are cryptographically anchored. They cannot be retroactively altered by anyone.
- **The attestation's timestamp is independently verifiable.** If a witnessing service is used, the timestamp is anchored by a third party. This matters when a contest alleges the will was backdated.
- **Pattern detection across a solicitor's practice.** If a solicitor repeatedly drafts wills where the witnesses die within months of execution, and the beneficiaries are always the same small circle, that pattern becomes visible in the verification data. A regulatory body (SRA, state bar) could flag solicitors with statistically improbable witness mortality rates — something impossible with paper-only records scattered across different filing cabinets.
- **Witness attestation vs. witness testimony.** In a traditional probate contest, the court needs to locate and examine the witnesses. If they are dead, the proponent of the will must prove validity through other means (self-proving affidavits, solicitor testimony, circumstantial evidence). A verified witness attestation is not a substitute for live testimony, but it is a **contemporaneous record** — created at the time of signing, not reconstructed years later — and courts may weigh it accordingly.

**Limitations of this approach:**
- A witness under the influencer's control will attest whatever they're told to. The attestation records their words, not their honesty.
- A complicit solicitor can publish attestations for witnesses who were not actually present. The hash verifies against the solicitor's domain, and the solicitor is the liar.
- The pattern detection only works if solicitors use Live Verify widely enough to create a statistical baseline. One firm in isolation reveals nothing.

The witness attestation approach doesn't prevent the mortal witness attack. It makes it **harder to get away with** — the attestation is a permanent, timestamped record that persists beyond the witness's death, and the pattern of witness mortality becomes a data point rather than an invisible coincidence.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Estate Planning Attorneys:** (The primary source).
**State Will Registries:** (e.g., North Carolina or International Will Registry).
**Corporate Trust Companies.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Solicitors draft and verify wills and testamentary estate documents.

```
✓ solicitors.example-firm.co.uk/wills/verify — Drafts and verifies wills and testamentary documents
  ✓ sra.org.uk/solicitors — Regulates solicitors in England and Wales
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive attorneys' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (testator name, date of execution, witness names, executor name, page number, revision ID, law firm/attorney ID, drafting date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the Last Will and Testament.


## Future Architecture: Registry-Based Hash Witnessing

**The core vulnerability today:** The solicitor who drafts the will is also the custodian of the canonical version. If the solicitor is the adversary — or is compromised, negligent, or complicit — they control the only authoritative copy. The witnesses attest to the signing ceremony but not to the document's contents (this is by design — testamentary privacy means the testator shouldn't have to reveal their inheritance plan to witnesses). The result is that nobody in the room except the solicitor knows what the document actually says, and nobody outside the room holds an independent record of what was signed.

**The architectural fix: separate drafter from custodian.**

This is the same separation that already exists in land registration. The solicitor prepares the property transfer, but the Land Registry is the authority. For wills, the equivalent would be:

### How it works

1. **Solicitor drafts the will** in a registry system — either a national registry or a regulated private provider operating under government oversight
2. **The registry computes the SHA-256** of the final draft and publishes the hash on the registry's domain, not the solicitor's
3. **At the signing ceremony,** the hash is displayed on the attestation page. The witnesses see it — they don't need to understand cryptography, they confirm: "I witnessed Margaret Willows sign the document identified as `WR-2026-44821` (hash `a7f3b2...c9`) on 15 March 2026"
4. **The witnesses' attestations are published** against the registry's domain as separate verifiable claims
5. **The testator receives a copy.** The registry holds the canonical version. The solicitor holds a working copy but is no longer the single point of trust

### What this fixes

- **Solicitor substitution attack:** The solicitor can't swap in a different PDF after signing — the witnessed hash pins the document. A different document produces a different hash, and the original witnessed hash is already on record at the registry
- **Independent custodian:** The registry holds the canonical version. The solicitor can't alter the stored copy without creating a hash mismatch
- **Witness attestation specificity:** Witnesses still don't read the contents (testamentary privacy preserved), but they attest to a *specific document* via its hash — not just "I saw someone sign something." This is a stronger attestation than current law requires
- **Post-mortem verifiability:** When witnesses die before probate, their attestations survive as timestamped, hash-linked records on the registry's domain. The court has contemporaneous evidence rather than reconstructed testimony

### The authority chain shifts

Today (solicitor as trust anchor):
```
verify:willows-law.com/wills/v — Solicitor attests to the will
  ← sra.org.uk — Regulates the solicitor
    ← gov.uk — Government root
```

Future (registry as trust anchor):
```
verify:wills.registry.gov.uk/v — Registry attests to the will's hash
  ← sra.org.uk — Attests the drafting solicitor is regulated
    ← gov.uk — Government root
```

The solicitor's role in the chain becomes *regulated drafter*, not *custodian of truth*.

### Existing infrastructure to build on

- **UK:** The [National Will Register](https://www.nationalwillregister.co.uk/) (Certainty) already records that a will exists and where it's stored, but not its contents or hash. Extending it to hold hashes (not contents) is a small step — the registry never sees the will text, only the hash and metadata
- **US:** Some states (North Carolina, Florida) already have will registries. Others could extend Surrogate's Court or Secretary of State infrastructure
- **Scotland:** The Books of Council and Session already provide a public registration service for wills — the closest existing model to hash-based registration

### What makes hash-witnessing practical

The witness doesn't need to understand SHA-256. At the signing ceremony, the attestation page shows:

```
Will Reference: WR-2026-44821
Document Integrity Code: a7f3b2...c9
```

The witness confirms the reference and code match what's on the page, then signs. This is no more complex than witnessing a signature today — it's one additional line to read. Over time it becomes as routine as "sign here, initial here."

### What this doesn't fix

- **Undue influence at drafting time.** If the testator is coerced into instructing the solicitor to draft a will they don't truly want, the registry faithfully records the coerced will. The hash is correct. The attestation is correct. The fraud happened before the system was involved.
- **Complicit registry staff.** If the registry itself is corrupt (unlikely for a government body, more plausible for a private provider), the custodian becomes the adversary again. Mitigation: independent witnessing service that also receives the hash at signing time, creating a third record.
- **Testator who doesn't read their own will.** Some elderly testators sign whatever the solicitor puts in front of them, trusting the solicitor to have followed their instructions. No system can verify that the testator understood and agreed with the contents — that remains a human judgment.

The registry model doesn't eliminate will fraud. It eliminates the solicitor's monopoly on the canonical version, creates an independent record of what was signed and who witnessed it, and makes patterns of abuse (repeated last-minute changes, witnesses who keep dying, beneficiaries who keep appearing) visible at a systemic level.

See [Legal Witnessing Future Architecture](../../docs/legal-witnessing-future-architecture.md) for the generalised model — including the lawyer's verbal hash confirmation step, the three distinct attestation roles, and applicability beyond wills to powers of attorney, deeds, affidavits, and contracts.

## Competition vs. Physical Security (Watermarks)

| Feature | Live Verify | Watermarked Paper | Online Court Docket |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tamper Detection** | **High.** Protects the actual text. | **Low.** Only protects the paper. | **High.** |
| **Versioning** | **Real-time.** Shows "Superseded." | **Zero.** Paper doesn't change. | **Manual.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lawyer. | **Printer-Bound.** | **System-Bound.** |
| **Cost** | **Free.** (Standard web hosting). | **High.** Specialized paper/ink. | **Medium.** Access fees. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Privacy Gap." Most people do not want to file their Will with a public court while they are still alive. Live Verify allows for **"Private Integrity"**—the Will stays in a private safe, but its cryptographic integrity is anchored to the lawyer's domain, ensuring it remains "Un-altered and Current" until the day it is needed.
