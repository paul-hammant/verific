## What is a P2P Payment Receipt?

In the modern mobile economy, **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Payments** move money in seconds. When you send money via Venmo, Zelle, or Cash App, you receive a digital receipt.

Because these apps move money instantly, they are the #1 target for **"Screenshot Scams."** A dishonest buyer shows a seller a pixel-perfect fake "Sent" screenshot to trick them into handing over a high-value item (like a phone or a car), when in reality, no money was ever moved. Verified hashes bind the **Transaction ID, Receiver @Handle, and Amount** to the payment platform's domain (e.g., `venmo.com` or `zellepay.com`).

**Why you should bother verifying:**

- **The scam happens at the curb.** You are selling a phone, a gaming console, or a bicycle. The buyer shows you their screen: "Payment Sent — $450.00." You hand over the item. You check your account later — nothing arrived. The screenshot was fabricated. The buyer is gone.
- **There is no recourse.** Unlike credit card chargebacks or bank transfers, P2P payments that were never made cannot be reversed — because there is nothing to reverse. You gave away physical goods based on a screenshot. The police will file a report; the money is not coming back.
- **Checking your own account is not enough.** Cellular dead spots, app delays, and pending statuses create a window where "it hasn't arrived yet" sounds plausible. A verified hash against the platform's domain confirms the transaction exists *before* you hand over the goods — regardless of whether your notification has arrived.

## Data Verified

Transaction ID, platform name (Venmo/Zelle/CashApp), sender name/@handle, receiver name/@handle, payment amount, date/time of transfer, payment status (Completed/Pending), note/memo text, payment method (last 4).

**Document Types:**
- **In-App Receipt:** The primary proof shown on the phone.
- **Email Confirmation:** Sent to both parties.
- **Monthly Transaction History:** (Linked hash) for tax/audit purposes.
- **Dispute Record:** Proof that a payment was flagged or reversed.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`venmo.com`, `zellepay.com`, `cash.app`) and the real-time status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Completed / Paid** — Funds have been successfully moved and cleared.
- **Pending / In-Review** — **ALERT:** Funds are held; do not hand over goods yet.
- **Cancelled / Failed** — **CRITICAL:** The payment was stopped; the paper/screenshot is a fraud.
- **Reversed** — **ALERT:** The sender has filed a fraud claim to pull the money back.

## Second-Party Use

The **Seller / Recipient** benefits from verification.

**Face-to-Face Sales Safety:** When selling a car on Facebook Marketplace, the seller asks the buyer to show the "Sent" screen. The seller scans the hash. "Verified by Venmo" ensures the seller that the $5,000 is actually in transit and the screenshot isn't a "Fake App" designed to steal the car.

**Rent Payment Proof:** A tenant can provide the verified hash of their "Rent Payment" to a landlord. This provides the landlord with cryptographic proof of payment, preventing "Late Fee" disputes caused by bank processing delays.

## Third-Party Use

**Tax Authorities / IRS**
**Business Income Audit:** For gig workers or small shops, verified P2P hashes provide "Audit-Proof" evidence of income, protecting them from being accused of "Under-Reporting" cash sales.

**Police / Fraud Investigators**
**Scam Tracking:** When a "Screenshot Scam" is reported, police use the verified hashes to determine if the "Fake App" used by the criminal was generating real-looking (but non-verifiable) IDs, helping to map the criminal's activity.

**Banks & Financial Lenders**
**Income Vetting:** Using verified P2P history as a "Secondary Income Signal" for individuals who don't have traditional W-2 jobs but have a high volume of verified gig-economy payments.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake App" Fraud Problem**

- **Screenshot Fabricators:** Apps that generate a realistic "Venmo Green" or "Zelle Blue" screen for any name and amount.
- **Status Masking:** Showing a "Sent" screen for a payment that the sender instantly cancelled using a stolen credit card.
- **Handle Spoofing:** Sending $1 to a handle like "@Venmo-Verification" to get a "Success" screen, then editing the $1 to $1,000 on a PDF.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National P2P Networks (Zelle).**
**Fintech Platforms (Venmo, Cash App, PayPal).**
**Regional Instant Payment Hubs (e.g., PIX in Brazil, UPI in India).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. P2P handles and payment amounts are highly sensitive social and financial data. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Payment Harvesting" by data scrapers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

P2P payment platforms are regulated money transmitters that issue digital receipts verifying completed transactions.

```
✓ venmo.com/receipt/verify — Licensed P2P payment platform
  ✓ fincen.gov — Administers US anti-money-laundering regulations
    ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

P2P payments are the "Cash of the Mobile Age." By turning digital receipts into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the informal economy from the multi-billion dollar cost of "Screenshot Scams" and ensure that "Sent" means "Spent."

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the P2P platform's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the payment receipt.
