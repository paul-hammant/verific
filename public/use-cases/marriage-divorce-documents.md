## Data Verified

Spouse full names, dates of birth, marriage date, license number, certificate serial number, officiant name, location of ceremony, county of issuance, date of recording.

**Document Types:**
- **Marriage Certificate:** Official proof of union (post-ceremony).
- **Divorce Decree:** Final court order dissolving a marriage.
- **Domestic Partnership:** For non-marriage legal unions.
- **Annulment Order:** (Linked hash) proving the union was voided.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`clarkcountynv.gov`, `nycourts.gov`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid/Recorded** — Record exists and matches the official registry.
- **Dissolved** — **ALERT:** Marriage was subsequently ended by divorce or annulment.
- **Amended** — Original record corrected (e.g., due to name spelling error).
- **Void** — Assigned to wrong parties or found to be fraudulent.

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Spouse(s)** benefit from verification.

**Name Change:** Proving to the Social Security Administration (SSA) or a bank that the "Marriage Certificate" isn't a fake PDF created to commit identity fraud. Verification against the county domain allows for instant, automated name-change processing.

**Immigration / Green Card:** Proving a "Bona Fide Marriage" to USCIS. A verified certificate from the county is the ultimate defense against "Fake Marriage" accusations during a visa interview.

**Insurance Enrollment:** Proving marital status to an employer's HR department to add a spouse to a health insurance plan.

## Third-Party Use

**Government Agencies (SSA / USCIS)**
**Identity Integrity:** Instantly verifying the foundational civil status of an applicant. Live Verify connects the agency directly to the county registrar, stopping "Paperwork Scams" where people use fake certificates to steal survivor benefits.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Title Vetting:** Verifying marital status during a property purchase to ensure "Spousal Consent" or "Homestead Rights" are properly addressed in the deed.

**Attorneys / Probate Courts**
**Heir Verification:** Confirming the legal status of a surviving spouse before distributing multimillion-dollar estate assets.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Bride" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Certificates:** Using a template to create a fake "Marriage Certificate" for a non-existent union to get a Green Card or military benefits.
- **Bigamy Concealment:** Presenting a "Valid" marriage paper while hiding that a "Divorce Decree" has already been issued for that union. Verification shows the *latest* status (Dissolved).
- **Name Tampering:** Editing a PDF to change the name of one spouse to gain access to their bank accounts or inheritance.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**County Clerks / Registrars:** (Primary issuers for marriage).
**Superior / Family Courts:** (Issuers for divorce decrees).
**State Departments of Health:** (Managing long-term vital records).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Marital status is highly private. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Scraping" of a county's marriage history by data brokers or stalkers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

The General Register Office issues marriage and divorce certificates under the Marriage Act 1949 and Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

```
✓ gro.gov.uk/marriage/verify — UK General Register Office marriage and divorce certificates
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the county clerk's or court's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (spouse names, dates of birth, marriage dates, license numbers, certificate serial numbers, officiant names, ceremony locations, recording dates) — never personal addresses or identification document details — providing non-repudiation of the certificate or decree and an audit trail government agencies and attorneys can inspect.

## Competition vs. Certified Copies (Raised Seals)

| Feature | Live Verify | Certified Copy (Physical Seal) | Public Portal (Online Search) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects every name/date. | **Binds Paper.** Doesn't prevent "Name Edits." | **Data-Only.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Manual.** Requires physical inspection. | **Slow.** Requires search & CAPTCHAs. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the County. | **Signature-Bound.** | **Gov-Bound.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** Fees of $20-$50 per copy are common. | **Medium.** Per-search fees. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Reach. Many counties do not have public-facing "Search Portals" for marriage records due to privacy laws. Live Verify allows the **Individual** to carry a portable, verifiable proof of their status that only reveals data when the physical document is presented, respecting privacy while providing absolute trust.
