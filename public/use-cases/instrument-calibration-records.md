## Data Verified

Instrument model/serial number, Asset ID, calibration date, technician name/Ph.D., reference standards used (NIST traceability), environmental conditions during test, PASS/FAIL status, specific drift measurements, issuing lab domain.

**Document Types:**
- **Instrument Calibration Record:** The primary technical proof of accuracy.
- **Service Log Extract:** For routine maintenance tracking.
- **Validation Protocol (IQ/OQ/PQ):** Proving the machine is installed correctly.
- **Deviation Report:** (Linked hash) for measurements taken out-of-tolerance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Calibration Lab or Manufacturer) and current record status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Data matches the lab's secure digital vault.
- **Expired** — Re-calibration is overdue; current data is unverified.
- **Adjusted** — Instrument was modified to return to spec.
- **Retracted** — **ALERT:** Data voided due to reference standard error.

## Second-Party Use

The **Lab Manager** (second party) receives the calibration record from the calibration lab (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the instrument's calibration status. Most of the time, the record sits in their lab's quality files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the calibration matches what the lab's system recorded and meets NIST traceability requirements.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about data quality, regulatory audits, or publication challenges—they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the calibration lab.

## Third-Party Use

The lab manager (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Peer Reviewers / Journal Editors**
**Integrity Vetting:** Instantly verifying the "Equipment Section" of a manuscript. Live Verify ensures the authors didn't "Smooth" the calibration data to hide noise in their results.

**FDA / Regulatory Auditors**
**GXP Audits:** During a clinical trial audit, inspectors can scan the stickers on the lab gear. "Verified by Agilent" or "Verified by Quantum Labs" ensures the instruments were in-tolerance on the date the patient samples were run.

**Legal Expert Witnesses**
**Forensic Accuracy:** In patent or liability litigation, verifying the historical accuracy of the instruments used to generate the evidence.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dry-Labbing" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Logs:** Lazy technicians writing "In-Tolerance" numbers in a logbook without actually running the 4-hour calibration sequence.
- **Date Alteration:** Editing a 2024 certificate to look like 2026 to avoid the $2,000 service fee.
- **Traceability Fraud:** Claiming a link to NIST or ISO standards when the lab's own gear is unverified.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- OEM Service Depts (Agilent, Thermo Fisher, Shimadzu)
- Independent Accredited Labs (ISO 17025 certified)
- University Metrology Units

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Calibration records contain many unpredictable variables that combine to create sufficient entropy—instrument serial number (unique alphanumeric), specific drift measurements (continuous values with multiple decimal places), environmental conditions (temperature/humidity to precise decimals), technician credentials (non-enumerable names and IDs), reference standard batch numbers, and precise calibration dates/times. The combination makes reverse-engineering a specific calibration record computationally infeasible without already knowing all the details.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Accredited calibration labs provide NIST-traceable calibrations following ISO/IEC 17025 standards.

```
✓ calibration.npl.co.uk — Calibrates scientific instruments against NIST standards
  ✓ ukas.com — Accredits UK calibration laboratories
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the calibration lab's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (instrument IDs, calibration dates, pass/fail results, reference standard IDs, technician credentials) — never client names, laboratory addresses, or proprietary measurement details — providing non-repudiation of the certificate and the results and an audit trail state quality authorities can inspect.

## Competition vs. LIMS (Lab Information Mgmt)

| Feature | Live Verify | LIMS Software (LabWare) | Scanned PDF Record |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lab. | **System-Bound.** Trust the DB admin. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Share with any journal/auditor. | **Zero.** External parties never get LIMS logins. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the Serial #. | **High.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Permanence** | **Archival.** Text is permanent. | **Ephemeral.** Databases get migrated/lost. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "External Trust" problem. A lab's internal LIMS is great for them, but useless for the **Scientific Community**. When a result is published or a drug is filed for approval, the trust must move with the data. Live Verify turns the **Static Calibration PDF** into a portable, cryptographically trusted asset.
