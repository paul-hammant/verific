## What is an EOB?

An **Explanation of Benefits (EOB)** is the document your health insurance company sends you after a doctor's visit. It is **NOT** a bill.

It tells you:
1.  **The Discount:** How much the insurance company saved you by negotiating with the doctor.
2.  **The Payment:** Exactly how much the insurance company paid.
3.  **The Debt:** Exactly how much the doctor is legally allowed to charge you.

Verified EOBs are essential for **HSA/FSA Reimbursement**. Fraudsters often edit these PDFs to inflate their "Patient Responsibility" to trick their tax-free savings account into releasing cash. Verified hashes ensure the $70 charge matches the insurer's actual adjudication.

## Data Verified

Patient name, member ID (partial), provider name, service date, CPT codes (procedures), billed amount, contracted discount, insurance payment, patient responsibility (copay/deductible), date of EOB issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Explanation of Benefits (EOB):** The primary post-service record.
- **Predetermination of Benefits:** (Linked hash) for high-cost surgery estimates.
- **HSA/FSA Substantiation Receipt:** Proving an expense was "eligible."
- **Tax-Deduction Summary:** Annual summary of patient responsibility.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`anthem.com`, `uhc.com`) and current claim status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Processed** — Data matches the insurer's final payment decision.
- **Adjusted** — **ALERT:** Original EOB was corrected; this version is void.
- **In-Appeal** — Patient has challenged the patient responsibility amount.
- **Denied** — Payment rejected (reason code verified).

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient** benefits from verification.

**HSA/FSA Reimbursement:** Proving to a 3rd party administrator (e.g., WEX or WageWorks) that the $70 charge was a verified medical expense. Verification removes the "Substantiation Request" nightmare where workers have their debit cards frozen due to "Unreadable Paper."

**Tax Audit Protection:** Proving to the IRS that medical deductions claimed on a tax return are backed by verified, non-altered insurance records.

## Third-Party Use

**HSA / FSA Administrators**
**Automated Approval:** Instantly verifying the "Patient Responsibility" amount from a PDF upload. Live Verify allows the administrator to skip the manual "Document Review" queue, releasing funds to the worker in seconds.

**Secondary Insurers (COB)**
**Coordination of Benefits:** Verifying exactly how much the primary insurer paid before calculating the secondary payment, stopping "Double-Dipping" fraud.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Medical Debt Vetting:** If a borrower has high medical bills, lenders can verify the EOBs to ensure the debt isn't being exaggerated or hasn't already been settled.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Healthcare Fraud" Problem**

- **HSA Draining:** Editing a $10 copay to look like $1,000 to trick an FSA administrator into releasing tax-free cash for personal use.
- **Balance Billing:** Clinics pretending they didn't receive an EOB showing a contracted discount, to bill the patient for the full retail amount.
- **Double Payouts:** Submitting the same EOB to two different insurance companies (e.g., work and spouse's plan) while altering the "Primary" status.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Health Insurance Carriers:** (Anthem, UHC, Aetna, Cigna).
**TPA Benefit Managers.**
**Medicare / Medicaid Portals.**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. EOBs contain sensitive medical procedure data. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for specific patient conditions.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Health insurance carriers issue EOBs under federal insurance regulator authority (CMS in the US).

```
✓ eob.unitedhealthcare.com/verify — Issues explanations of benefits
  ✓ cms.gov — Administers US Medicare and Medicaid programs
    ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the health insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (claim IDs, service dates, CPT codes, billed amounts, insurance payments, patient responsibility amounts, EOB dates) — never patient names or medical procedure details — providing non-repudiation of the EOB and an audit trail CMS and HSA administrators can inspect.

## Competition vs. Insurance Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | Insurer Mobile App | Scanned PDF / Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Control** | **High.** Patient shares only the *Single Claim*. | **Low.** App access often reveals *full* medical history. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Insurer. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any HSA provider. | **Siloed.** | **Universal.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires 2FA, login, and navigation. | **N/A.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Selective Privacy. A patient needs to prove a $70 debt to their HSA provider without exposing that the visit was for a sensitive condition or a high-cost medication. Live Verify turns the **Static Statement** into a portable, private "Proof of Expense."
