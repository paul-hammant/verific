## What is an Umbrella Liability Policy?

An **Umbrella Liability Policy** is the "Final Line of Defense" for a person's net worth. It provides broad coverage over and above primary policies like Home and Auto. If a policyholder is sued for $2 million after a car accident, but their auto policy only pays $500,000, the "Umbrella" pays the remaining $1.5 million.

These policies are critical for **Asset Protection**. Fraud is high-stakes: high-net-worth individuals or professionals (e.g., Doctors, CEOs) might "edit" a policy to show a $5M limit instead of a $1M limit to qualify for a business partnership or a high-value lease. Similarly, they might hide that their "Underlying Policy" (Auto) was cancelled, which legally voids the Umbrella coverage. Verified hashes bind the **Excess Limits, Underlying Policy IDs, and Effective Dates** to the insurer's domain (e.g., `libertymutual.com` or `chubb.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, insurer name, policyholder name, residential address, excess liability limit (per occurrence and aggregate), underlying policy numbers and limits (Auto/Home/Watercraft), policy term, worldwide coverage status, retained limit (SIR), broker ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Umbrella Policy Summary:** The 1-page "Proof of Protection."
- **Policy Declarations Page:** Detailed financial terms.
- **Evidence of Umbrella Insurance:** For business or legal requirements.
- **Underlying Coverage Audit:** Proof that the base policies are active.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`chubb.com`, `pureinsurance.com`, `libertymutual.com`) and the policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Verified** — Full excess coverage is in force.
- **Underlying Gap Alert** — **CRITICAL:** One of the base policies (e.g., Auto) has lapsed, voiding the umbrella.
- **Cancelled** — **CRITICAL:** The umbrella policy has been terminated for non-payment or risk change.
- **Limit Mismatch** — **ALERT:** The $5M limit on the paper was altered from the $1M limit in the system.

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder (Asset Owner)** benefits from verification.

**Business Deal Closure:** When a high-net-worth individual joins a private partnership or board, they must prove they have substantial personal liability coverage. A verified hash allows the other partners to see **"VERIFIED $5M UMBRELLA"** on their phone, removing the doubt that the new partner is a "Liability Risk."

**Estate Planning:** Providing a verified hash of total personal protection to an estate executor or trustee to ensure the "Asset Protection Plan" is fully funded and active.

## Third-Party Use

**Lenders to High-Net-Worth Individuals**
**Risk Management:** Before issuing a "Lombard Loan" (lending against stock portfolios), the bank scans the borrower's umbrella hash. This ensures the borrower's wealth won't be wiped out by a random lawsuit, protecting the bank's source of repayment.

**Private Flight / Yacht Operators**
**Liability Vetting:** Before allowing a guest to charter a $50M yacht or jet, the operator verifies the guest's personal liability hash. "Verified by Chubb" ensure the operator that the guest has the financial backing to cover a catastrophic accident on board.

**Real Estate Developers**
**Contractor Vetting:** Ensuring that a high-end general contractor has the "Excess Liability" required to cover a structural failure on a luxury condo project.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Shield" Fraud Problem**

- **Limit Inflation:** Changing a $1M umbrella to a $10M one on a PDF to bypass a lender's "Net Worth" requirement.
- **Underlying Policy Hiding:** Editing a policy to remove the "Mandatory underlying auto limit" clause to hide a gap.
- **Date Stretching:** Presenting an expired policy as "Active" to close a business deal.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**High-Net-Worth Specialty Insurers.**
**Global Personal Lines Carriers.**
**Wealth Management Compliance Portals.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Personal liability limits and home addresses are sensitive indicators of wealth. The hash must be salted to prevent "Wealth Mapping" of the population by hackers or predatory data brokers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Chubb and umbrella liability insurers issue excess liability policies and are regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance framework.

```
✓ umbrella.chubb.com/verify — Excess liability insurer issuing umbrella policies and limits
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Umbrella insurance is the "Anchor of Wealth." By turning specialty policies into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that "Financial Protection" is backed by the professional truth of the carrier, protecting the stability of the high-end credit and service markets.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, excess liability limits, underlying policy IDs, policy term, coverage status) — never policyholder address or personal financial information — providing non-repudiation of umbrella policy issuance.
