## Data Verified

Project name, exact site address, General Contractor (GC) name, project owner name, Total Completed Value (TCV), construction start/end dates, specific peril sub-limits (Theft, Flood, Transit), issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Builders Risk Certificate (COI):** Provided to the project owner and lenders.
- **Reporting Form:** Monthly updates on construction value.
- **Evidence of Property Insurance:** For high-value equipment on site.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`zurichna.com`, `travelers.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; project covered.
- **Terminated** — Project completed; coverage ceased.
- **Suspended** — Safety stop-work order from underwriter.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated due to non-payment or site abandonment.

## Second-Party Use

The **General Contractor** (second party) receives the builders risk certificate from the insurance carrier (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the coverage. Most of the time, the document sits in the project files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the coverage matches what the carrier's system recorded and hasn't been altered or cancelled.

**Future Optionality:** If a claim arises—whether fire, theft, or weather damage—they have cryptographic proof of the coverage terms ready without needing to contact the insurer.

## Third-Party Use

The general contractor (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Construction Lenders (Banks)**
**Collateral Monitoring:** Builders risk is the only protection for the bank's collateral (the half-built building). Verification ensures the GC didn't quietly cancel the policy to save money while spending the bank's loan funds.

**Project Owners (Clients)**
**Risk Transfer:** Ensuring that if the project burns down at 50% completion, the GC's insurance will actually cover the replacement cost, preventing a total loss for the owner.

**Equipment Lessors**
**Theft Coverage:** Companies renting cranes/scaffolding verify that their equipment is covered under the project's "Theft of Materials" or "Off-Site Storage" endorsements.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Construction Gap" Fraud Problem**

- **Project Swapping:** Using one valid certificate for a "Safe" suburban project to cover a "High-Risk" urban high-rise.
- **Value Deflation:** Declaring a $10M value to the insurer (to get a cheap rate) but showing a $40M certificate to the bank.
- **Hidden Cancellation:** Keeping the paper certificate on the job-site trailer wall after the policy was cancelled for non-payment 3 months ago.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Construction Underwriters (Zurich, Travelers, AIG, AXA XL)
- MGA Specialists (Victor, RT Specialty)

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Builders risk certificates contain many unpredictable variables: unique project names, specific site addresses, general contractor company names, exact coverage values (often to the dollar), specific construction dates, and unique policy numbers. The combination of these project-specific details creates sufficient entropy to prevent hash enumeration attacks.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Zurich underwrites construction site and builders risk insurance for UK projects.

```
✓ buildersrisk.zurich.co.uk/verify — Underwrites construction site and builders risk insurance
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (project values, coverage limits, construction dates, policy numbers) — never contractor financial details or project owner private information — providing non-repudiation of the coverage it issued.

## Competition vs. Project Management Software (Procore)

| Feature | Live Verify | Procore / Autodesk Build | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Insurer. | **System-Bound.** Relies on the GC uploading correctly. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Queries the carrier's live file. | **Static.** Relies on the last manual update. | **Manual.** |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any bank/owner. | **Siloed.** Only works for people on that specific project. | **Universal.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Independent Truth." Project management software like Procore is a "Self-Reporting" system—it only shows what the GC uploads. Live Verify provides an **independent digital verification** from the Insurer's domain, ensuring the GC's claims match the Underwriter's reality.
