## Data Verified

Full name, Alien Registration Number (A-Number), Date of birth, Country of birth, Resident Since date, Card expiration date, Visa Category (e.g., IR1, EB2), Photo (via hash), Fingerprint status (hash), Issuing USCIS office.

**Document Types:**
- **Green Card (I-551):** Proof of permanent residency.
- **Naturalization Certificate (N-550):** Proof of citizenship.
- **I-797 Approval Notice:** Proving a pending or approved petition.
- **Advance Parole (I-512L):** Travel authorization for pending applicants.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uscis.gov`) and real-time legal standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Bearer has valid legal status in the U.S.
- **Terminated** — **ALERT:** Status has been revoked (e.g., due to criminal conviction).
- **In-Removal** — Bearer is currently in deportation proceedings.
- **Expired** — Card is no longer valid; renewal or status proof required.

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Individual** benefits from verification.

**Identity Protection:** Proving their status to a landlord, bank, or employer without handing over the high-value physical card (which costs $540+ to replace if lost). A verified digital hash allows the holder to keep the original in a safe deposit box.

**Domestic Travel:** Proving legal residency to TSA or local police during domestic travel, especially in "Border Zones" where proof of status is legally required.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers (I-9 Compliance)**
**Zero-Trust Onboarding:** Instantly verifying that a candidate's Green Card isn't a "High-Quality Forgery." Black-market cards look perfect to the eye; Live Verify connects the manager directly to the USCIS record in seconds.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Loan Eligibility:** Verifying that a borrower is a "Lawful Permanent Resident," which is a mandatory requirement for most Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac conforming loans.

**Local Police (Traffic Stops)**
**Status Verification:** Confirming the legal status of an individual during a stop in jurisdictions that coordinate with federal immigration authorities.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Black Market" Fraud Problem**

- **Novice Fakes:** Realistic-looking plastic cards sold online for $200. These lack the cryptographic link to `uscis.gov`.
- **Identity Swapping:** Using a "Clean" person's A-number and editing the photo on the card.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A person who was deported last month keeping their physical Green Card to return to the U.S. and find work.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).**
**DHS SAVE System:** (The backend data source).
**National Registries:** (In other countries, e.g., UK Home Office).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Immigration data is a high-value target for hackers and activists. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to map the entire immigrant population.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

```
✓ uscis.gov/status/verify — Administers US immigration and naturalization
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the government agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the immigration status document.

## Competition vs. E-Verify / SAVE

| Feature | Live Verify | E-Verify (Employer System) | Physical Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Open.** Small businesses/landlords can verify. | **Restricted.** Only for registered federal contractors/employers. | **Manual.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `uscis.gov`. | **Direct DB Access.** High trust. | **Mechanical.** Prone to forgery. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often flags for "Manual Review" taking 3-10 days. | **Instant.** |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Verified PDF works for banks/lawyers. | **Zero.** Data is trapped in the gov portal. | **Universal.** |

**Narrower conclusion:** USCIS, SAVE, and other official status systems should remain primary where they are directly available and legally appropriate. This use case is more credible as a complementary bridge for copy and card workflows, where banks, landlords, DMV clerks, or other third parties only have the immigration document in hand and would otherwise fall back to visual inspection.
