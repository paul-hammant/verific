## What are Vocational Certifications?

In the industrial world, a **Vocational Certificate** is the proof that a worker has the "Hard Skills" needed for a specific trade—whether it's **Structural Welding**, **HVAC Refrigerant Handling**, or **Heavy Equipment Operation**. These certifications are the "License to Earn" for millions of skilled laborers.

The problem is that "Trade School" certificates are easily forged. Shady contractors or workers might "edit" a certificate to turn a "Basic Welding" pass into a "Certified Nuclear Welder" to get onto a high-paying project. In high-risk fields (e.g., oil rigs or aircraft maintenance), a fake certification can lead to catastrophic structural failures. Verified hashes bind the **Trade Code, Completion Date, and Instructor ID** to the technical school's or the standard body's domain (e.g., `aws.org` or `lincolntec.edu`).

## Data Verified

Student name, school ID, trade specialization, specific technical codes (e.g., AWS D1.1, EPA 608), date of completion, credit hours, instructor name/ID, school accreditation number, certificate serial ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Technical Certificate:** The primary "Diploma" for trades.
- **Skills Transcript:** Detailing specific machine/tool competencies.
- **Safety Clearance Card:** (Linked hash) for high-risk sites.
- **Apprenticeship Log:** Proof of on-the-job training hours.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`lincolntech.edu`, `aws.org`, `nait.ca`) and the credential standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Active** — The certificate is authentic and the student is a graduate.
- **Disciplinary Alert** — **ALERT:** The certificate was voided due to fraud or ethics.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** (For safety certs) The skill must be re-certified.
- **Incomplete** — **ALERT:** Coursework finished, but final hands-on test is pending.

## Second-Party Use

The **Skilled Worker (Graduate)** benefits from verification.

**Hiring Efficiency:** When applying for a job at a major industrial site (e.g., a shipyard or refinery), the worker provides the verified hash of their "Welding Ticket." The foreman can instantly see **"VERIFIED AWS D1.1"** on their phone, allowing the worker to start immediately without a 3-day "Skills Audit" wait.

**Career Branding:** A tradesperson can include a verified "Master Tech" badge on their website or LinkedIn. "Verified by Lincoln Tech" provides the homeowner or contractor with the proof needed to trust the worker with a complex job.

## Third-Party Use

**General Contractors / Project Managers**
**Liability Control:** Before allowing a sub-contractor's crew into a high-pressure pipe zone, the manager scans their hashes. Verification ensures every worker is actually trained for that specific risk, protecting the GC from multi-million dollar "un-skilled labor" lawsuits.

**Safety Regulators (OSHA / HSE)**
**Audit Integrity:** During a surprise site inspection, the agent scans random certificates in the job trailer. Live Verify ensures the company isn't "Fabricating" training to hide a lack of qualified staff.

**Labor Unions**
**Pension & Dues Vetting:** Verifying that a worker's "Hours Completed" matches the digital record before assigning them to a higher pay-tier.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Pencil Whip" Fraud Problem**

- **Hour Inflation:** Changing a "10-hour introductory course" into a "400-hour master course" on a PDF.
- **Code Padding:** Adding "Nuclear Grade" or "Underwater" endorsements to a standard welding certificate.
- **School Mimicry:** Using a reputable academy's logo to vouch for training that never occurred.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Trade Associations (AWS, ASHRAE).**
**Vocational & Technical Colleges.**
**Proprietary Manufacturer Schools (e.g., Ford, Caterpillar).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low to Medium. While graduation status is public, individual exam scores and student IDs should be salted to protect professional privacy.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Vocational certifications are regulated by Ofqual in the UK, which sets standards for all qualifications in trades and technical skills, including City & Guilds certifications.

```
✓ cityandguilds.com/verify — Issues vocational and trade certifications
  ✓ ofqual.gov.uk — Regulates qualifications and exams in England
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Vocational skills are the "Physical Code" of civilization. By turning certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that "Job Readiness" is backed by cryptographic proof, protecting the safety of the public and the livelihoods of honest tradespeople.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the school's or trade association's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (trade code, completion date, instructor ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the certification.
