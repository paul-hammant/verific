## What is a Settlement Statement?

A **Settlement Statement** (typically the **ALTA** or **HUD-1**) is the "Final Scorecard" of a real estate transaction. It lists every penny that changed hands: the purchase price, loan amounts, taxes, realtor commissions, and "Prorations" for utilities. It shows exactly how much the buyer must pay and how much the seller will receive.

Because this document governs the distribution of hundreds of thousands of dollars, it is a primary target for **Mortgage and Wire Fraud**. Criminals use fake settlement statements to trick banks into releasing loan funds to "Phantom Payees," or they "edit" a statement to hide illegal "Kickbacks" to unlicensed parties. Verified hashes bind the **Net Payouts, Loan Amounts, and Settlement Agent ID** to the title company's or the lender's domain (e.g., `firstam.com` or `stewart.com`).

**Why verification matters here:**

- **A single altered line item redirects six-figure sums.** Changing the payoff amount to one lender, inserting a phantom "consulting fee," or modifying the wire instructions for the seller's proceeds — any of these can divert $50,000–$500,000 to a fraudulent account. The settlement statement is the instruction set for the money; altering it alters where the money goes.
- **Everyone in the chain relies on this document.** The buyer, seller, lender, title company, and real estate agents all use the settlement statement to confirm the numbers. If one party receives a tampered version, the entire closing proceeds on false information.
- **Discovery comes too late.** The seller expects $482,000 in proceeds. The funds are wired. Three days later, the seller's account shows nothing — because the statement was altered to redirect the wire. The money is in a foreign account and unrecoverable.

## Data Verified

Escrow/File number, property address, buyer name, seller name, lender name, sale price, loan amount, individual fee amounts (title, escrow, recording), tax prorations, net cash to buyer/seller, settlement agent ID, closing date.

**Document Types:**
- **ALTA Settlement Statement:** The primary closing summary.
- **HUD-1 Settlement Statement:** For older or specific government loans.
- **Closing Disclosure (CD):** (Linked hash) the lender's final truth-in-lending form.
- **Disbursement Authorization:** Proof of the actual wire triggers.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`firstam.com`, `fidelity.com`, `title-portal.org`) and the closing standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Closed / Funded** — Funds have been disbursed and the deed is recorded.
- **Pending Closing** — Statement is valid; awaiting final wire.
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** A post-closing correction was issued; this version is void.
- **Rescinded** — **CRITICAL:** The transaction was cancelled due to fraud or failure.

## Second-Party Use

The **Buyer / Seller** benefits from verification.

**Tax Deduction Proof:** A homeowner can provide the verified hash of their "Settlement Statement" to the IRS to prove "Deductible Closing Costs" (like mortgage points or property tax prorations) with cryptographic certainty, avoiding the rejection of deductions due to un-readable scans.

**Wire Fraud Defense:** Before sending a $100,000 wire, the buyer scans the verified hash provided by the title company. "Verified by Springfield Title" ensures the wire instructions and amounts are authentic, stopping "Business Email Compromise" (BEC) scams at the source.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Underwriters**
**Post-Closing Audit:** Instantly verifying thousands of loan files. Live Verify ensures the "Sale Price" and "Down Payment" in the bank's file match the digital truth at the title company, stopping "Equity Skimming" or "Hidden Second Mortgage" fraud.

**Secondary Market Investors**
**Portfolio Due Diligence:** Before buying a pool of mortgages, the investor scans the hashes of the settlement statements. Verification ensures that the "LTV" (Loan-to-Value) ratios are based on authentic purchase prices.

**State Real Estate Commissions**
**Compliance Audit:** Verifying that realtor commissions paid on the settlement statement match the verified hashes of the original listing agreements, stopping "Off-Book" illegal payments.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Payoff" Fraud Problem**

- **Fee Padding:** Adding a "$500 Courier Fee" to a PDF that the buyer never actually agreed to pay.
- **Kickback Hiding:** Editing a statement to hide a payment to an unlicensed "consultant" or "referral partner."
- **Sale Price Inflation:** Changing a $400,000 sale to $500,000 on a PDF to trick a lender into providing a 100% LTV loan.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Title Insurers.**
**Local Escrow Agencies.**
**Electronic Recording (e-Recording) Portals.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Individual financial payoffs and property values are extremely sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Wealth Harvesting" or "Homeowner Targeting" by predators.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Settlement statements must comply with RESPA and are regulated by the CFPB.

```
✓ settlement.firstam.com — Issues real estate settlement statements
  ✓ cfpb.gov — Regulates US consumer financial protection
    ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Settlement statements are the "Financial DNA" of a home. By turning static PDFs into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the public from wire fraud and ensure that the multi-trillion dollar mortgage market is based on the digital truth of the closing table.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the settlement agent's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (escrow file number, sale price, loan amount, net payouts, closing date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the settlement statement.
