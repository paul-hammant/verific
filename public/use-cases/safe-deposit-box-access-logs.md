## What is a Safe Deposit Box Access Log?

A **Safe Deposit Box Access Log** is the physical record of every time a high-security vault box was opened. It records the date, time, and the identity of the person who entered the vault, along with the signature of the bank officer who witnessed the access.

In the world of **Estate Law**, these logs are "The Smoking Gun." If a box holder dies and their $100,000 diamond ring is missing, the family scans the access log to see if a greedy relative "visited" the box before the executor was appointed. Fraud is high-stakes: dishonest bank employees or relatives may try to "backdate" or "delete" a log entry to hide an unauthorized entry. Verified hashes bind the **Access Timestamp, Box Number, and Officer ID** to the bank's domain (e.g., `wellsfargo.com` or `barclays.co.uk`).

## Data Verified

Box number, branch ID, holder name, authorized signer name, identification method (e.g., ID verified), date of access, precise entry/exit timestamps, bank officer name/ID, witness signature (via hash).

**Document Types:**
- **Access Sign-in Card:** The paper card signed at each visit.
- **Entry Log Extract:** A digital summary provided for legal discovery.
- **Power of Attorney Authorization:** (Linked hash) proving someone else was allowed in.
- **Box Drill Report:** Record of a forced opening (e.g., for non-payment).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`chase.com`, `hsbc.com`) and the log integrity.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified Entry** — The access event matches the bank's internal vault security record.
- **Unauthorized Alert** — **CRITICAL:** A visit was recorded on the paper that has no matching entry in the bank's digital security system.
- **Amended Log** — **ALERT:** An error in the log was corrected; see corrected version.
- **Access Blocked** — **ALERT:** The box is under legal hold or police seal.

## Second-Party Use

The **Box Holder** (second party) receives the access log from the bank (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The box holder has their own verified copy of every vault access. Most of the time, the document sits in their personal files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The box holder can confirm at any time that the log matches what the bank's security system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about estate matters, insurance claims, or suspected theft—the box holder or their heirs have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the bank.

## Third-Party Use

The box holder (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Probate Courts / Executors (Asset Reconciliation)**
When a box holder dies, the executor receives verified access logs from the estate. If the logs show **"VERIFIED ENTRY - 15 MAR,"** and the decedent died on 14 MAR, they have cryptographic proof to investigate whoever accessed the box, ensuring no assets were siphoned off before the estate was settled.

**Insurance Companies (Claims Evidence)**
When filing a claim for stolen jewelry, the box holder provides verified access logs to prove the items were kept in the bank vault and to establish a timeline of when theft could have occurred.

**Internal Bank Auditors (Vault Security Audit)**
Bank auditors randomly scan access cards across 50 branches. Verification ensures that officers aren't "padding" the logs or failing to record visits, which is a major regulatory compliance requirement (KYC/AML).

**Law Enforcement (Investigation)**
During a money laundering investigation, police receive verified access logs showing the "Pattern of Access" for a suspect's safe deposit box without needing to wait for a 2-week subpoena response from the bank's legal department.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Ghost" Fraud Problem**

- **Entry Deletion:** Removing a line from a paper card to hide that a suspect visited the vault.
- **Backdating:** Adding an entry today but dating it "Last Month" to satisfy a legal requirement.
- **Officer Impersonation:** Forging a bank officer's signature on a fake "Power of Attorney" access event.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Retail Banks / Credit Unions
- Private Vault Facilities
- Government Seizure Units (e.g., IRS/FBI)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Vault access is extremely private. While each log contains unique combinations of precise timestamps, box numbers, officer IDs, and customer names that provide significant entropy, the sensitive nature of this data—and the risk that bad actors could track high-net-worth individuals' vault visit patterns—means salt is essential. Salt prevents "box number harvesting" and protects customers from being targeted based on their vault access frequency.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Barclays maintains safe deposit boxes and vault access logs and is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

```
✓ vault.barclays.co.uk/access/verify — Bank vault operator maintaining access logs and security
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK banks and deposit-takers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the bank's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (box number, access timestamp, branch ID, officer ID) — never plaintext or customer and signer identities — providing non-repudiation of the access event and audit trail.

## Rationale

Safe deposit boxes are the "Final Sanctum" of privacy. By turning the access log into a verifiable digital bridge, we protect the most valuable assets from the most trusted threats—insiders and relatives.
