## What are Travel Package Confirmations?

A **Travel Package Confirmation** is the "Master Receipt" for an all-inclusive vacation. It bundles together high-value assets: round-trip airfare, 7 nights at a luxury resort, airport transfers, and excursions. These vouchers are worth thousands of dollars and serve as the "Key" to enter the resort and board the flights.

Fraud is common in the "Secondary Market." Scammers sell fake "Discounted Packages" on social media using realistic-looking templates from famous operators. Similarly, travelers sometimes "edit" a confirmation to add an extra person or a "Premium Drink Package" that wasn't paid for. Verified hashes bind the **Traveler Names, Inclusions, and Booking Reference** to the tour operator's domain (e.g., `tui.com` or `expedia.com`).

## Data Verified

Booking reference number, operator name, traveler names, destination, resort name, stay dates, room category, itemized inclusions (e.g., beverage tier, credits), payment status, cancellation policy hash.

**Document Types:**
- **Booking Confirmation:** The primary electronic/printed receipt.
- **Vacation Voucher:** Presented at the resort for check-in.
- **Transfer Notice:** For the airport shuttle driver.
- **Exclusion List:** (Linked hash) what the package *doesn't* cover.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`tui.com`, `expedia.com`, `sandals.com`) and the booking standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Fully Paid / Confirmed** — Booking is valid and funds are cleared.
- **Checked In** — Guests have arrived at the resort.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** The trip has been voided; no services authorized.
- **Modification Active** — A newer version of the package exists.

## Second-Party Use

The **Traveler (Guest)** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Fraud Assurance:** When buying a "Last Minute Deal" from a third-party seller, the guest can scan the provided confirmation hash. If it returns **"VERIFIED - ISLAND ESCAPES,"** they can pay with confidence. If it returns **"UNKNOWN,"** they avoid a $4,000 scam.

**Resort Check-in:** Upon arrival at a busy resort, the guest scans their own voucher. "Verified by Island Escapes" ensures the front desk that the "Premium Suite" and "Butler Service" listed on the paper are actually paid for, preventing awkward disputes at the desk.

## Third-Party Use

**Resort Front-Office Managers**
**Inclusion Integrity:** Verifying that a guest claiming "Unlimited Spa Access" actually has it in their verified package, stopping the common "pencil-editing" of printed vouchers to gain free perks.

**Travel Insurance Underwriters**
**Refund Adjudication:** If a guest claims a refund for a "Missed Trip," the insurer scans the verified confirmation to see the exact cancellation policy and value of the bundle, preventing "Double-Dipping" where a guest gets a refund from the operator AND the insurer.

**Charter Flight Operators**
**Manifest Vetting:** Ensuring that every passenger boarding the "Package Flight" has a verified, paid-in-full booking with the tour operator.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Bundle Bypass" Fraud Problem**

- **Perk Inflation:** Adding a "$500 Resort Credit" line to a standard PDF voucher.
- **Ghost Bookings:** Creating fake confirmations for a resort that has no record of the guest.
- **Resell Scams:** Selling the same "Verified" PDF to 5 different people (verification reveals the "Already Checked In" status).

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Tour Operators.**
**Online Travel Agencies (OTAs).**
**Direct Resort Groups.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Traveler names and room numbers are private. The hash must be salted to prevent "Resort Roster Scraping" by competitors or criminals.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Travel package confirmations are issued by licensed tour operators and regulated by the UK aviation authority.

```
✓ package.tui.co.uk/verify — Issues all-inclusive travel package confirmations and booking vouchers
  ✓ caa.co.uk — Regulates UK civil aviation
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Travel packages are high-value "Soft Assets." By turning them into verifiable digital bridges, we create a "Voucher of Truth" that protects the guest's vacation and the operator's revenue from the high cost of manual verification and fraud.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive operators' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (booking reference number, operator name, traveler names, destination, resort name, stay dates, room category, itemized inclusions, payment status, cancellation policy hash) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the travel package booking confirmation.
