## Data Verified

Athlete name, event discipline (e.g., 100m, Marathon), time/distance achieved (to 1/1000th precision), wind speed, reaction time, venue, date of performance, timing system used (FAT vs Chip), ratification status.

**Document Types:**
- **Record Ratification Certificate:** Final legal proof of a world/national record.
- **Timing Slip:** Printed instantly at the finish line for local meets.
- **Doping Control Receipt:** Linking the performance to a clean test (hash-binding).
- **Course Certification:** Proving a marathon route was actually the claimed distance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`worldathletics.org`, `ncaa.org`) and the current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Ratified** — Performance is official and in the record books.
- **Pending** — Waiting for doping control clearance or technical review.
- **Invalidated** — Disqualified (e.g., doping violation found later).
- **Former Record** — Performance was a record but has since been broken.

## Second-Party Use

The **Athlete** benefits from verification.

**Sponsorship Contracts:** Proving to Nike or Adidas that a claimed "Personal Best" or "World Ranking" is official, triggering performance bonuses in their contract.

**College Recruiting:** High school athletes providing verified "Verified by State Federation" times to college coaches, distinguishing them from unverified "hand-timed" claims.

**Olympic Entry:** Proving they have met the "Olympic Qualifying Standard" at a sanctioned meet.

## Third-Party Use

**College Coaches / Scouts**
**Talent Identification:** Coaches scan thousands of athlete profiles. Verification allows them to instantly trust times from remote, unknown competitions without calling meet directors.

**Anti-Doping Agencies (WADA)**
**Performance Analysis:** Linking "sudden performance spikes" to verified timing data to target testing more effectively.

**Sports Media / Broadcasters**
**Fact Checking:** Instantly verifying "World Lead" claims during a live broadcast by scanning the official results sheet.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Fast" Fraud Problem**

- **Hand-Timing Fraud:** Claiming a 10.2s 100m time (hand-timed) as if it were a 10.2s FAT (Fully Automatic Timing) time.
- **Course Cutting:** In marathons, cutting corners or using a relay runner but claiming the full distance.
- **Wind-Aided Records:** Presenting a record set with +4.0 m/s wind (illegal) as a "Wind-Legal" record.
- **Age-Class Fraud:** Adults competing in youth categories to win scholarships.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Governing Bodies:** (World Athletics, FINA, FIFA).
**Timing Companies:** (Omega, Seiko, Swiss Timing).
**Race Platforms:** (Athletic.net, RunSignUp).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

World Athletics and other sport governing bodies are the sole custodians of official records. Their authority to ratify results derives from universal adoption of their competition rules and timing standards.

```
✓ results.worldathletics.org/verify — Ratifies official athletic records and timing results
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the timing authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (event, date, result) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.

## Scope and Limitations

**Where Live Verify adds value:**
- **Legacy meets** without digital infrastructure — small schools, rural areas, developing countries
- **Paper certificates** issued by federations that don't have searchable online databases
- **Cross-border verification** where a foreign federation's results aren't accessible to domestic recruiters

**Where digital platforms already solve this:**
- **Athletic.net, RunSignUp, MileSplit** — Major platforms already provide verified results with direct API access
- **World Athletics, USATF** — Governing bodies maintain authoritative databases for elite/ratified performances
- **Chip timing companies (Omega, Swiss Timing)** — Results are digitally signed and database-accessible

**Realistic scope:** Live Verify is a bridge technology for the long tail of athletic events that haven't digitized. For elite sports and well-funded programs, digital-native verification is already dominant. This use case targets the gap — the rural high school meet timed by a volunteer with a stopwatch and a printed certificate.

## Competition vs. Result Databases

| Feature | Live Verify | Online Results (Athletic.net) | Photo-Finish (Visual) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the Federation domain. | **Social.** Relies on the meet director uploading correctly. | **Forensic.** Requires expert eyes to interpret. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Performance.** Proves the *result* matches the *athlete*. | **Database.** Prone to data entry errors or "Ghost Results." | **Static.** Just an image of the finish line. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the bib or certificate. | **Variable.** Meet results can take days to appear online. | **Slow.** Requires access to specialized software. |

**Why OCR fits the gap:** Athletic results are decentralized. Thousands of local meets happen every weekend without digital integration. Live Verify allows a kid in a rural high school to carry a "Token of Proof" from their local timing company that is as trustworthy as an Olympic final result, bridging the gap between the field and the recruiters.
