## What is B2B Credit Control?

When businesses trade on credit terms (buy now, pay in 30/60/90 days), the supplier takes on risk. Before extending credit, they need to know: **Is this person authorized to commit their company to purchases?**

The classic fraud: someone claims purchasing authority they don't have, places orders, goods are shipped, and the company refuses to pay — "that person wasn't authorized." The supplier is stuck with an unenforceable debt.

## The Unauthorized Purchaser Problem

**Common fraud patterns:**

| Scenario | What happens | Who loses |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Rogue employee** | Employee places orders for personal benefit (resells goods, kickbacks) | Supplier if company denies liability |
| **Former employee** | Terminated employee continues placing orders using old credentials | Supplier ships to someone with no authority |
| **Impersonation** | Fraudster claims to work for reputable company, places orders | Supplier ships, real company never ordered |
| **Authority exceeded** | Buyer authorized for £10K orders places £100K order | Disputed — may be unenforceable above limit |

**Without verification:** Supplier relies on phone numbers, email domains, past behavior. All easily faked or exploited.

**With verification:** Supplier scans purchasing authority confirmation before shipping. Authority is current, specific limits are clear, and there's cryptographic proof of what was authorized.

## Data Verified

**Authorized person name**, **company name**, **company registration number**, **role/title**, **specific authority limits** (monetary, category, duration), **excluded authorities**, **issuing officer**, **issue date**, **expiry date**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Authority currently valid
- **Expired** — Past expiry date, renewal needed
- **Revoked** — Authority withdrawn (termination, role change, misconduct)
- **Suspended** — Temporarily inactive pending review
- **Superseded** — Replaced by updated authorization

**Why verify trade references?**
- Fraudsters fabricate references from non-existent companies
- References may be from colluding parties
- Verification proves the reference came from a real company's domain

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Legal Framework | Key Differences |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **UK** | Companies Act 2006, common law agency | Directors bind company; employees need actual/apparent authority |
| **US** | UCC Article 2, state agency law | Similar principles; more variation by state |
| **EU** | National company law + Commercial Agents Directive | Varies by country; some require written authority for certain contracts |

**Key legal concept:** "Apparent authority" — if a company holds someone out as having authority (title, business cards, past dealings), third parties may be able to enforce contracts even if actual authority was lacking. Verification creates clearer boundaries.

## Third-Party Use

**Suppliers/vendors** — Verify before shipping on credit terms
**Credit insurers** — Assess whether proper controls exist
**Factors/invoice financiers** — Verify underlying transactions are legitimate
**Auditors** — Test purchasing controls and segregation of duties
**Legal counsel** — Evidence in debt recovery, fraud cases

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Suppliers can't easily verify if someone placing an order is actually authorized
- Fraudsters exploit gaps between employee termination and supplier notification
- Disputes about authority are expensive to litigate
- Trade references can be fabricated or from colluding parties

**The Fix:** Company issues purchasing authority confirmations with verification URLs. Suppliers check before extending credit or shipping high-value orders. Revocation is immediate — terminated employee's authority shows "Revoked" the same day.

**The workflow:**
1. New supplier relationship → Buyer provides purchasing authority confirmation
2. Supplier scans verification URL → Confirms authority and limits
3. Order within limits → Ship with confidence
4. Order exceeds limits → Request higher authorization or decline
5. Verification fails or shows revoked → Do not ship, contact company directly

**Adoption incentive:** Companies that verify reduce bad debt. Companies that issue confirmations get better credit terms (suppliers see them as lower risk). Insurance premiums may decrease for companies with verified purchasing controls.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Companies issue purchasing authority confirmations to control their own internal delegation of spending authority. Self-authorized by company governance and employment law.

```
✓ credit.example-corp.com/verify — Issues purchasing authority confirmations and credit control attestations
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Integration with Existing Systems

**ERP/procurement systems** — Can require verification URL for new supplier setups
**Credit management software** — Automatic verification check before order approval
**Accounts receivable** — Flag orders from unverified purchasers for manual review

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the company's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the purchasing authority confirmation.
