## What is an Elevation Certificate?

If you live near the coast or a river, you need **Flood Insurance**. The price of that insurance depends on one number: exactly how high your "Lowest Floor" is above sea level.

An **Elevation Certificate** is the official paper from a licensed surveyor that proves this height.

"Elevation Padding" is a common fraud: owners often "Edit" their certificate to change an 8-foot height into an 11-foot height to save $2,000/year on insurance premiums. Verified hashes connect the insurance company directly to the **Surveyor's field notes**, ensuring the price of risk is based on math, not Photoshop.

## Data Verified

Property address, FEMA Flood Zone (e.g., AE, V, X), Base Flood Elevation (BFE), Lowest Floor Elevation (LFE), datum used (NAVD 88), surveyor name/license, date of survey, building diagram type (1-9), presence of flood vents.

**Document Types:**
- **FEMA Form 086-0-33:** The standard Elevation Certificate.
- **LOMA (Letter of Map Amendment):** To officially remove a property from a flood zone.
- **V-Zone Design Certificate:** For high-risk coastal structures.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Surveyor or the City Floodplain Manager) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Certificate matches the surveyor's official field notes.
- **Superseded** — FEMA has updated the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM); new certificate required.
- **In-Dispute** — Elevation data challenged by the insurance carrier.
- **Invalid** — Surveyor license inactive or serial mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner** benefits from verification.

**Lower Insurance Premiums:** Proving to a flood insurance agent (NFIP or private) that the "11.2 ft" elevation is a verified fact. A verified certificate removes the "Risk Loading" that insurers apply to unverified or suspicious documentation, potentially saving the owner thousands of dollars per year.

**Home Sale:** Providing verified "Flood Proof" status to a potential buyer, de-risking the purchase of coastal property and ensuring the buyer's lender will approve the mortgage.

## Third-Party Use

**Flood Insurance Underwriters**
**Risk Rating:** Insurers see thousands of PDFs. Verification ensures the elevation data hasn't been "Nudged" higher by a dishonest owner to lower their premium. Live Verify connects the underwriter directly to the surveyor's domain.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Loan Compliance:** Verifying that a property in a high-risk zone has the mandatory, non-altered elevation certificate required for a federally-backed loan.

**City Floodplain Managers**
**Code Enforcement:** Instantly verifying that new construction meets the city's "Freeboard" requirements (minimum elevation above BFE).

## Verification Architecture

**The "High Water" Fraud Problem**

- **Elevation Padding:** Editing a PDF to change an 8.2 ft elevation to 11.2 ft to bypass insurance requirements or building codes.
- **Zone Swapping:** Editing the map reference to move a property from a high-risk "AE" zone to a low-risk "X" zone.
- **Surveyor Impersonation:** Forging the signature and seal of a local Professional Land Surveyor (PLS) on a fake certificate.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Licensed Surveyors:** (The primary data creators).
**Civil Engineering Firms.**
**Municipal Floodplain Managers:** (Hosting hashes for all certificates in the city).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Certifies building elevations for federal flood insurance.

```
✓ msc.fema.gov/verify — Certifies building elevations for federal flood insurance
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the surveyor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (property addresses, FEMA flood zones, base flood elevations, survey dates, surveyor licenses) — never property owner names or precise location details — providing non-repudiation of the certificate and an audit trail state insurance companies can inspect.

## Competition vs. FEMA Map Service Center

| Feature | Live Verify | FEMA MSC (Public Map) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Property Data.** Protects the *Floor Elevation*. | **Binds Geography.** Only shows the *Zone*. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Surveyor. | **Gov-Bound.** Bound to FEMA. | **Visual.** |
| **Specificity** | **Exact.** Verifies *this specific building*. | **General.** Shows the whole neighborhood. | **Full.** But untrusted. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires address search and map reading. | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Floor Gap." FEMA maps tell you where the water *might* go. But only an Elevation Certificate tells you where the **Building Floor** actually is. Live Verify turns that building-specific data into a verifiable digital anchor, ensuring that flood risk is calculated on facts, not Photoshop.
