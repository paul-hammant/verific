## What is an Annuity Rate Certification?

An **Annuity** is a financial product where you give an insurance company a lump sum, and they promise to pay you a monthly income for the rest of your life.

The **Rate Certification** is the document where the company's actuary (math expert) swears to the government that:
1.  **The Rate is Safe:** The company isn't promising 8% if they can only earn 4% (which would bankrupt them).
2.  **The Math is Real:** They have tested the rates against 1,000 different economic scenarios.

Verification ensures that the "High Interest Rate" an agent promises you on their tablet matches what the company officially filed with the state.

## Document Format Examples

The annuity certification can arrive through different channels. Verification of them can happen from many of those starting points of claims made in a document/page: Email, WhatsApp, Windows or File explorer, PDF viewers. Forum apps like Discord or Slack, printed paper too, via a Camera app.

## Data Verified

Certifying actuary name/qualifications, product name/series, guaranteed interest rates, mortality table version, filing date, jurisdiction of approval.

**Document Types:**
- **Actuarial Certification of Rates:** Filed with State DOI (Dept of Insurance).
- **Annuity Illustration:** Sample payout provided to the customer.
- **Product Prospectus Summary:** High-level terms for agents.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Insurance Carrier) and the filing status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Filed & Approved** — Rates are current and authorized for sale.
- **Withdrawn** — Product no longer available or rates changed.
- **Pending** — Rates submitted to regulators but not yet active.

## Second-Party Use

The **Annuity Purchaser** (retiree) benefits from verification.

**Peace of Mind:** Verifying that the 5.25% rate promised by the independent agent matches the official actuarial filing at the insurance company.

**Audit Trail:** Keeping a verified record of the "Guaranteed Minimum" rates at the time of purchase, which may be needed 20 years later if there is a dispute over the contract value.

## Third-Party Use

**Financial Advisors (Fiduciary)**
**Due Diligence:** Advisors have a fiduciary duty to verify product claims. Scanning the certification ensures the product is exactly what it claims to be before recommending it to a client.

**State Insurance Regulators**
**Market Conduct Exams:** Regulators can scan random agent illustrations in the field to ensure they match the verified, approved rates, catching "rogue agent" misrepresentation instantly.

**Internal Compliance**
**Sales Oversight:** Ensuring that no agent is using an old, higher-rate illustration to "bait and switch" customers after a rate drop.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Rate" Fraud Problem**

- **Bait and Switch:** Agents showing a 6% illustration when the actual approved rate is 4%.
- **Expired Illustrations:** Using last month's higher rates to close a deal today.
- **Stochastic Misrepresentation:** Claiming "1,000 scenarios pass" when the actual filing shows high failure rates in low-interest environments.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Life Insurance Companies:** (Prudential, MetLife, Allianz, etc.)
**State Departments of Insurance (DOI):** (As the ultimate approving authority).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Legal & General certifies actuarial pricing for UK annuity products.

```
✓ annuity.legalandgeneral.co.uk/pricing/verify — Certifies actuarial pricing for annuity products
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK life insurance and pensions firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the certification.


## Competition vs. DOI SERFF Database

| Feature | Live Verify | SERFF / State Website |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consumer Access** | **Universal.** Scan the brochure. | **Very Hard.** Public access to filing databases is notoriously difficult for non-experts. |
| **Linking** | **Direct.** Binds the physical paper to the filing. | **Disconnected.** Finding the filing for "SecureIncome Plus v3" among 5,000 filings is hard. |
| **Trust** | **Brand-bound.** `prudential.com` vouches for it. | **Gov-bound.** High trust, but low usability. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Annuities are complex, high-stakes products. The "Last Mile" of the sales process happens at a kitchen table with a printed illustration. Live Verify brings the weight of the company's actuarial department to that table, ensuring the salesperson isn't making promises the actuary didn't sign off on.
