## What is an Escrow Release?

An escrow release confirms that funds or documents held by a neutral third party have been disbursed according to the escrow agreement. This occurs at real estate closings, M&A transactions, software escrow releases, and various commercial holdback arrangements.

Escrow releases are high-value fraud targets. Fake release letters can misdirect funds or trigger premature disbursements.

## Data Verified

Escrow agent name, file/agreement number, parties (buyer/seller, depositor/beneficiary), property or materials description, escrow amount, release conditions, release date, recipient of disbursement.

**Document Types:**
- **Closing Statement:** Final disbursement at real estate closing.
- **Holdback Release:** Post-closing release of retained funds.
- **Software Escrow Release:** Source code or IP released to beneficiary.
- **M&A Escrow Release:** Acquisition holdback disbursement.
- **Construction Escrow:** Progress payments or final release.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`chicagotitle.com`, `ironmountain.com`) and current escrow status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Released** — Funds or materials fully disbursed.
- **Partial Release** — Some funds released, remainder held.
- **Pending Conditions** — Release conditions not yet satisfied.
- **Disputed** — Release contested by a party.
- **Clawback** — Funds recalled due to fraud or breach.

## Second-Party Use

The **Seller/Depositor** benefits from verification.

**Funds Confirmation:** Sellers need proof that escrow closed and funds were properly disbursed for their tax and financial records.

**Holdback Recovery:** When repair or condition holdbacks are released, sellers need verified documentation for their records.

**Warranty Claims:** If issues arise post-closing, sellers may need to prove what funds were disbursed and when.

## Third-Party Use

**Buyers / Beneficiaries**
**Closing Confirmation:** Buyers need verified proof that escrow closed and title transferred for mortgage records and insurance.

**Lenders**
**Loan Funding:** Mortgage lenders verify that escrow closed properly before funding is complete. Wire fraud often targets escrow closings.

**Insurance Companies**
**Policy Inception:** Title insurance policies activate at closing. Verified closing statements confirm the insured event.

**Tax Authorities**
**Basis Confirmation:** IRS and state tax authorities may verify closing statements when auditing real estate transactions.

**Accountants / Auditors**
**Financial Statements:** Verified escrow releases confirm transaction completion for financial reporting.

## Verification Architecture

**The Escrow Release Fraud Problem**

- **Wire Fraud:** Business email compromise redirects escrow disbursements to criminal accounts.
- **Fake Closings:** Fraudulent closing statements claim transactions completed that never happened.
- **Holdback Theft:** Forged holdback releases divert funds meant for repairs or conditions.
- **Software Escrow Fraud:** Fake release notices claim source code access.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Title Companies:** (Chicago Title, Stewart, Fidelity, First American).
**Escrow Companies:** Independent escrow agents.
**Software Escrow Providers:** (Iron Mountain, EscrowTech, NCC Group).
**Banks:** Acting as escrow agents for M&A transactions.
**Attorneys:** In states with attorney escrow practices.

**Wire Fraud Prevention**

Live Verify doesn't prevent wire fraud directly, but it provides an independent verification path. Before wiring funds, parties can verify that closing instructions match the escrow agent's verified hash.

**Multi-Party Verification**

Complex transactions may require multiple parties to verify the same release. The hash provides a single source of truth that all parties can independently confirm.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Escrow releases are issued by licensed title and escrow companies regulated by the California real estate authority.

```
✓ escrow.firstam.com/release/verify — Issues escrow closing statements and release authorizations
  ✓ dre.ca.gov — Regulates California real estate
    ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the escrow holder's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (file number, property reference, sale price or holdback amount, closing date, release date, recipient name, condition status) — never plaintext transaction terms — providing non-repudiation of the escrow release.
