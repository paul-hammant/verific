## What is a Baggage PIR?

When your suitcase doesn't arrive at the airport, the airline agent gives you a **Property Irregularity Report (PIR)**. This is a simple thermal-paper receipt with a reference number like `CDG-AF-998877`.

This receipt is the only "Proof of Loss" accepted by travel insurance companies.

Because these receipts are easy to forge with a basic printer, "baggage fraud" is a multi-million dollar problem. Fraudsters file fake reports for flights they took just to collect $500 from their insurance company. Verified PIRs stop this scam instantly.

## Data Verified

Passenger name, Property Irregularity Report (PIR) reference, flight details, baggage tag numbers, damage description or delay status, authorization amount for expenses, date of report.

**Document Types:**
- **Property Irregularity Report (PIR):** Issued when a bag is lost or delayed.
- **Damage Report:** Issued when a bag is broken but delivered.
- **Baggage Fee Receipt:** Proving payment for excess/checked bags.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`airfrance.com`, `delta.com`) and the claim status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Open** — Bag is still missing; claim active.
- **Found** — Bag located; en route to passenger.
- **Closed** — Claim settled and paid.
- **Denied** — Claim rejected (e.g., report filed too late).

## Second-Party Use

The **Passenger** benefits from verification.

**Travel Insurance Payout:** Insurers (e.g., Allianz, AMEX) require a PIR from the airline to pay for "Delayed Baggage" coverage. A verified PIR prevents the insurer from rejecting the claim due to "unreadable" or "suspicious" documentation.

**Emergency Purchases:** Proving to a shop that you have a verified "EUR 100 authorization" from the airline might allow for direct billing or just peace of mind when spending money you expect to get back.

## Third-Party Use

**Travel Insurance Companies**
**Fraud Detection:** People often forge PIRs to claim $500 for "lost bags" that were never actually lost. Scanning the verification hash instantly proves the airline has an active PIR for that passenger/flight.

**Employers / Expense Teams**
**Reimbursement Audit:** If an employee expenses $200 for "new clothes due to lost bag," Finance can verify the PIR to ensure the bag was actually delayed and the airline didn't already pay for the clothes.

**Corporate Travel Agencies (TMCs)**
**Support:** TMCs can monitor the verified status of a client's lost bag to provide proactive updates and handle the paperwork for them.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Lost Bag" Fraud Problem**

- **PIR Forgery:** Using a template to create a realistic Property Irregularity Report for a flight the traveler actually took, just to collect insurance money.
- **Amount Inflation:** Editing a $50 authorization to read $500.
- **Double-Dipping:** Claiming full value from both the airline and the private insurer.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Airlines:** (Air France, BA, United, etc.)
**Ground Handlers:** (Swissport, Menzies) who often issue the PIRs on behalf of airlines.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Airlines and ground handlers issue Property Irregularity Reports (PIRs) as the sole authorized custodians of baggage claim records. Self-authorized by their operational responsibility for baggage handling.

```
✓ baggage.ba.com/claim/verify — Issues baggage claim receipts and property irregularity reports
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the airline's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the baggage claim receipt.


## Competition vs. Airline Apps

| Feature | Live Verify | Airline Mobile App | Paper PIR |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shareability** | **High.** Can be sent to any insurance company. | **Low.** Cannot share "App access" with an insurer. | **High.** But untrusted. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the claim details. | **Dynamic.** Status changes in-app. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Offline Proof** | **Strong.** The paper/PDF is the anchor. | **None.** No app access = no proof. | **Medium.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The Insurance Bridge. Airline apps are "Walled Gardens." While they are great for the passenger, they are useless for the **Travel Insurer** who needs a trusted artifact to justify a payout. Live Verify turns the airline's internal record into a portable, verifiable document that bridges the gap between the airline and the insurance industry.
