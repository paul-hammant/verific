## What is a Cruise Folio?

When you disembark from a cruise ship, you receive a **Final Guest Folio**. It is a detailed list of every dollar you spent onboard: from the "Business Internet Package" to the "Midnight Margaritas."

For business travelers, the "Folio" is a nightmare to expense. They must "Scrub" the personal fun (drinks/spa) from the legitimate business costs (internet/conference fees).

Fraud happens when employees edit their folio to hide personal spending or to inflate business costs. Verified hashes allow a company's finance department to see the **un-altered line items**, ensuring that the company only pays for the work-related parts of the trip.

## Data Verified

Passenger name, reservation ID, ship name, voyage dates, stateroom number, itemized charges (Internet, Gratuities, Drinks, Excursions), total settled amount, payment method (last 4 digits).

**Document Types:**
- **Final Guest Folio:** Delivered under the door on the last morning.
- **Interim Statement:** For mid-cruise budget checks.
- **Shore Excursion Receipt:** Proving participation in a specific tour.
- **VAT / Tax Invoice:** For European cruises requiring tax documentation.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`royalcaribbean.com`, `carnival.com`) and folio status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Settled** — Account paid in full; disembarkation authorized.
- **Refunded** — A credit was issued post-cruise (e.g., for a missed port).
- **Disputed** — Passenger has formally challenged a charge.
- **Amended** — A revised folio exists (e.g., after a post-cruise correction).

## Second-Party Use

The **Cruise Guest** benefits from verification.

**Business Expense Reimbursement:** Proving to an employer that the $142.50 charge for "Internet Package" was a verified business cost and not a series of cocktails. Verification separates "Work Expenses" from "Personal Luxury" on a complex multi-page folio.

**Tax Compliance:** Differentiating between non-deductible personal travel and deductible business components (e.g., a "Seminar at Sea" registration fee) using verified, non-alterable line items.

## Third-Party Use

**Corporate Expense Platforms (SAP Concur / Expensify)**
**Automatic Audit:** The platform can scan the folio hash to instantly validate line items against the cruise line's official ledger, flagging "Photoshopped" upgrades or deleted personal charges.

**Travel Insurers**
**Claim Substantiation:** If a passenger falls ill and needs to prove they didn't consume their "Pre-paid Excursions," the verified folio provides proof of credit or lack thereof from the cruise line.

**Banks (Credit Card Disputes)**
**Resolution:** Instantly verifying the "Final Settled Amount" during a "Double-Charge" dispute, bypassing the 30-day manual evidence cycle.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Folio Scrubbing" Fraud Problem**

- **Personal Charge Deletion:** Employees editing their cruise folio to "delete" the Casino and Bar charges before sending it to Finance for reimbursement of the Internet and Gratuities.
- **Fabricated Credits:** Adding a fake "Onboard Credit" to a receipt to get cash back from an insurance claim.
- **Reservation Theft:** Using a template to create a fake folio for a trip the traveler never actually took to claim business travel deductions.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Cruise Lines:** (Royal Caribbean, Carnival, NCL, MSC).
**River Cruise Operators:** (Viking, AmaWaterways).
**Onboard Payment Systems:** (e.g., OceanMedallion).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Cruise lines issue final folios accounting for all onboard charges and payments. Self-authorized by their operation of the vessel and merchant contract with passengers.

```
✓ folio.pocruises.com/verify — Issues cruise final folios and onboard account statements
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the cruise line's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (booking number, voyage date, final amount, line-item categories) — never guest name, payment methods, or itemized personal spending — providing non-repudiation of the folio issuance.


## Competition vs. Credit Card Statements

| Feature | Live Verify | Credit Card Statement | Scanned PDF Folio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Granularity** | **High.** Shows specific items (Wifi vs Alcohol). | **Zero.** Just shows "CARNIVAL CRUISES $1,200". | **High.** But untrusted. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds every line item. | **High.** But lacks detail. | **Zero.** Easily edited. |
| **Privacy** | **Selective.** Share only the verified extract. | **Low.** Exposes all other personal spending on the card. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Freshness** | **Instant.** Verified at disembarkation. | **Laggy.** Charges often aggregate at the end. | **Static.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Scrubbing" problem. Corporate finance departments hate cruise folios because they are 10 pages long and full of personal "fun" spending. Live Verify allows an employee to provide a **Verified Extract** of just the business items, giving the company 100% trust without the employee needing to share their "Bar Tab" with their boss.
