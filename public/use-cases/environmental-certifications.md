## What is a LEED Certificate?

**LEED** (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is the world's most famous "Green Building" award. If a building is **LEED Gold** or **Platinum**, it means it has verified high performance in energy saving, water efficiency, and air quality.

For a real estate owner, a LEED plaque in the lobby is worth **millions of dollars**. Large corporations (like Google or Salesforce) often refuse to lease any office that isn't verified green.

Fraud happens when a developer uses a "Fake Plaque" or an outdated certificate to hide that the building's green systems (like solar or high-tech glass) were never actually installed. Live Verify ensures the plaque on the wall is a live link to the USGBC's official record.

## Data Verified

Project name, owner, certification level (Certified, Silver, Gold, Platinum), rating system version, verified point total, certification date, geographic location, project ID.

**Document Types:**
- **LEED Certificate:** The formal wall plaque/paper.
- **WELL Certification:** For healthy indoor environments.
- **BREEAM Rating:** International sustainability standard.
- **Green Star:** (Australia/NZ).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`usgbc.org`, `gbci.org`, `bregroup.com`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Building meets all standards and is active.
- **Revoked** — Certification pulled due to reporting error or loss of compliance.
- **Recertification Required** — For operations & maintenance (O+M) standards.
- **Invalid** — Project ID or location mismatch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner / REIT** benefits from verification.

**Higher Valuations:** Proving to a buyer or appraiser that the building's "LEED Gold" status is verified by the source. Studies show verified green buildings sell for a 10-20% premium over non-certified buildings.

**Anchor Tenants:** Proving sustainability compliance to tech giants (Google, Salesforce) who have strict mandates to only lease space in verified green buildings.

**ESG Finance:** Qualifying for lower-cost "Green Bonds" or sustainable financing by providing verified hashes of the building portfolio's certifications.

## Third-Party Use

**Commercial Real Estate Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** Before wiring $100M for an office tower, the buyer scans the plaque in the lobby. "Verified by USGBC" prevents the seller from using a "Fake Gold Certificate" to hide a building that barely meets code.

**Municipalities**
**Tax Incentives:** Many cities offer tax breaks for green buildings. Verification provides the city's revenue department with an automated audit trail for these incentives.

**Employee Recruiters**
**Talent Attraction:** High-value Gen Z and Millennial talent often choose employers based on environmental values. A verified "WELL" or "LEED" certificate in the office lobby is a powerful recruiting tool.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Greenwashing" Fraud Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** Using a high-quality template to create a "LEED Platinum" plaque for a standard building.
- **Status Faking:** Displaying a 10-year-old certificate for a building whose sustainability systems (HVAC, solar) have since degraded or been replaced with cheaper components.
- **Point Padding:** Altering the "Points Total" extract to look like the building is just 1 point away from Platinum to trick an appraiser.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**USGBC / GBCI:** (LEED standards).
**Building Research Establishment (BRE):** (BREEAM standards).
**International WELL Building Institute (IWBI).**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Building Research Establishment issues BREEAM certifications for green building performance standards.

```
✓ breeam.bregroup.com — Certifies buildings against environmental standards
  ✓ ukas.com — Accredits UK testing laboratories
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the certifying body's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (certificate number, issue date, certification type, certification level, expiration date) — never property details, building specifications, or auditor names — providing non-repudiation of the environmental certification issuance.


## Competition vs. Project Directories

| Feature | Live Verify | USGBC Project Directory | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Standard Body. | **Database.** Direct from source. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Experience** | **Instant.** Scan the plaque on the wall. | **Difficult.** Requires searching by address/name on a phone. | **Instant.** |
| **Field Access** | **High.** Mobile-optimized for lobby visits. | **Low.** Maps and lists are hard to navigate on small screens. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Points.** Protects the data. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Lobby Moment." Trust is built when someone walks into a building and sees the certification. Live Verify turns that **Visual Trophy** into a **Live Security Token**, ensuring that the prestige of the plaque is backed by the current cryptographic reality of the standard body.
