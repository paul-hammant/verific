## Data Verified

Insured name, policy number, face amount (Death Benefit), policy type (Whole/Term/Universal), cash value accumulation (if applicable), primary/contingent beneficiaries, base premium, effective date, issuing carrier, active riders (e.g., Waiver of Premium).

**Document Types:**
- **Policy Schedule (Declarations):** The 1-page primary summary.
- **Beneficiary Designation Form:** Proving who gets the payout.
- **Collateral Assignment:** Proving the policy is pledged to a bank.
- **Annual Performance Summary:** Showing cash value growth.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`newyorklife.com`, `prudential.com`, `metlife.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; coverage active.
- **Lapsed** — **ALERT:** Coverage terminated due to non-payment.
- **Paid-Up** — No further premiums required to maintain coverage.
- **Pledged** — Policy has a verified lien from a third-party lender.

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder (Insured)** benefits from verification.

**Collateralized Loans:** Proving to a bank that their "Whole Life" policy has a verified $142,000 cash value. This allows the owner to take a low-interest "Policy Loan" or use the insurance as collateral for a mortgage without waiting weeks for a manual "Verification of Coverage" form from the insurer.

**Estate Planning:** Providing a verified "Wealth Token" to an estate attorney or trust officer, ensuring the death benefit is accurately accounted for in the family's total assets.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Private Banks**
**Asset Integrity:** Verifying the existence and value of permanent life insurance. Live Verify ensures the borrower hasn't "Edited" a $10,000 term policy to look like a $1M whole-life asset to inflate their net worth.

**Divorce / Settlement Attorneys**
**Valuation Proof:** Instantly verifying the "Cash Surrender Value" of a policy during asset division in a marital dissolution.

**Institutional Lenders**
**Lien Verification:** Checking if a policy being offered as collateral already has a verified "Assignment" to a different bank.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Policy" Fraud Problem**

- **Benefit Inflation:** Editing a $100,000 policy PDF to read $1,000,000 to trick a lender or business partner.
- **Lapse Concealment:** Showing an old "In Force" paper for a policy that lapsed 2 years ago.
- **Beneficiary Tampering:** Editing the beneficiary page to change the payout from a spouse to a secret creditor or a fraudster's account.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Carriers:** (New York Life, Prudential, Northwestern Mutual).
**Mutual Companies:** (Where the policyholders own the firm).
**Fraternal Benefit Societies.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Life insurance involves family health and massive wealth. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for people with high-value policies.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Aviva, a regulated life insurance provider, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified life insurance policies and coverage confirmation.

```
✓ policy.aviva.co.uk/life/verify — Issues verified life insurance policies
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK life insurance and pensions firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, face amount, issue date, status) — never beneficiary names or cash surrender values — providing non-repudiation of the policy and an audit trail lenders and estate attorneys can inspect.


## Competition vs. MIB Group (Industry DB)

| Feature | Live Verify | MIB Group (Industry Exchange) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Policyholders and banks. | **Restricted.** Only for insurance companies. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Retention** | **50+ Years.** Archival text. | **Ephemeral.** Records often age out. | **Durable.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Beneficiary*. | **Vague.** Often only shows "Coverage exists." | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Lifetime" reality. Life insurance is a 50-year asset. Digital portals change every 5 years. Live Verify turns the **Static Paper Policy** (which the owner keeps in a safe) into a permanent, verifiable financial link that survives the death of IT systems and the changing of brokers.
