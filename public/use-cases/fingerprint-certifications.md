## What is a Fingerprint Certificate?

For high-security jobs (like working at a bank or a nuclear plant), a simple background check isn't enough. You must have your fingerprints "rolled" onto an FBI FD-258 card.

The **Certificate of Fingerprinting** is the paper signed by a Notary Public or Police Officer swearing: "I verified this person's ID and I watched them roll these specific prints."

"Identity Swapping" is a common fraud: a person with a criminal record sends a "clean" friend to the fingerprinting appointment to get a clear background check. Verified hashes (including a photo of the person being printed) stop this "Biometric Fraud" at the source.

## Data Verified

Applicant name, date of birth, fingerprint card serial number (e.g., FD-258 ID), purpose of check (FBI, FINRA, State), date of fingerprinting, notary name/commission number, jurisdiction (State/County), LiveScan reference ID (if applicable).

**Document Types:**
- **Fingerprint Certification Letter:** Attached to the physical card.
- **LiveScan Receipt:** Digital proof of submission to DOJ/FBI.
- **Identity Verification Form:** (I-9 equivalent) for high-security roles.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Notary Platform or Police Agency) and the submission standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Notary has verified the identity and prints match the record.
- **Submitted to FBI** — Digital transmission to the federal database confirmed.
- **Rejected** — **ALERT:** Prints found to be unreadable or smudged.
- **Expired** — Certification date is > 90 days old (most backgrounds require fresh prints).

## Second-Party Use

The **Applicant** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Fraud:** Proving to an employer or licensing board that they *actually* attended the fingerprinting appointment and the person who took the prints was a verified notary. This prevents "Identity Swapping" accusations.

**Case Tracking:** Instantly verifying the "Submission Status" of their prints to the FBI without waiting for a snail-mail response.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers (High-Security)**
**Intake Integrity:** Before giving a new hire access to a nuclear plant or a bank vault, the HR manager scans the fingerprint certification. "Verified by Notary-Check" ensures the candidate didn't just "Sign their own card" and use fake fingerprints.

**State Licensing Boards (Nursing / Law)**
**Credential Vetting:** Verifying that the mandatory background check prints were taken in accordance with state laws.

**Federal Agencies (FBI / DHS)**
**Channeler Oversight:** Verifying that private "Fingerprint Channelers" are accurately reporting the identity of the people they are processing.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Dirty Hands" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Swapping:** Sending a "Clean" friend to the fingerprint appointment to hide a criminal record. Verification of the *photo hash* on the certificate stops this.
- **Date Alteration:** Editing a 2-year-old certification PDF to read "2026" to avoid the $100 fee for a new background check.
- **Notary Forgery:** Using a fake rubber stamp to "certify" a card that was actually filled out in a basement.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Police Departments:** (Primary issuers for ink-and-roll).
**LiveScan Vendors:** (e.g., IdentoGO, UPS Store).
**Online Notary Platforms:** (DocuSign, Notarize).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Biometric association data is the most sensitive PII. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for criminal background checks.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Certifies fingerprints and identity for background checks.

```
✓ livescan.fbi.gov/verify — Certifies fingerprints and identity for background checks
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the fingerprinting authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (fingerprint ID, submission date, clearance type, notary ID) — never fingerprint data, personal identification details, or background check results — providing non-repudiation of the fingerprint certification issuance.


## Competition vs. FBI Portal (CJIS)

| Feature | Live Verify | FBI CJIS Portal | Scanned PDF Receipt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Notary/Firm. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Takes 3-7 days for "Background Result." | **Instant.** |
| **Accessibility** | **Open.** Any employer can verify the *event*. | **Restricted.** Only authorized entities can see results. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Protects the Card ID. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Handoff Gap." The FBI takes weeks to return a background check result. But an employer needs to know **today** if the candidate actually went to the appointment. Live Verify turns the **Fingerprint Receipt** into a live, trusted "Proof of Action" that bridges the gap during the long federal waiting period.
