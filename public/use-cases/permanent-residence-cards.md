## What is a Green Card?

The **Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551)**, commonly known as a **Green Card**, is the most high-value identity document in the United States. It proves that a non-citizen is authorized to live and work in the country indefinitely. It is the "Master Key" to employment, social security benefits, and international travel.

Because it grants broad rights, Green Cards are a major target for high-end forgery. But the strongest verification paths are still the official ones: USCIS, DHS-backed systems, employer workflows like I-9/E-Verify, and carrier or border systems where available. Live Verify is therefore a **complementary** bridge for copy-based or lower-capability relying parties, not the dominant architecture.

## Data Verified

USCIS Alien Registration Number (A-Number), full name, category code (e.g., CR1, E11, RE8), card serial number, date of birth, country of birth, resident-since date, card expiration date, photograph (via hash), fingerprint status (hash), issuing office.

**Document Types:**
- **Permanent Resident Card:** (Form I-551) The plastic card.
- **ADIT Stamp (I-551):** (Temporary) placed in a passport.
- **I-797 Extension Notice:** (Linked hash) extending an expired card.
- **Transportation Letter:** (Linked hash) for boarding if the card is lost abroad.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uscis.gov`) and the real-time status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized / Permanent** — Holder is in good standing and authorized to work.
- **Conditional** — **ALERT:** Subject must file to remove conditions by [Date].
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** Status terminated (e.g., due to criminal acts or fraud).
- **Reported Stolen** — **CRITICAL:** The card number has been flagged by the owner.

## Second-Party Use

The **Permanent Resident (Holder)** benefits from verification.

**Copy-Based Employment Prep:** Before formal I-9 completion, a worker may send a copy-based credential packet to HR or a recruiter. Live Verify can help the employer treat that copy more safely, while understanding that formal work-authorization systems remain primary.

**Record Confidence:** A resident can check whether a card copy or linked extension notice still maps to a current USCIS record, while understanding that border and carrier systems remain authoritative.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers / Federal Contractors**
For formal work authorization, official employment-verification workflows remain primary. Live Verify is more plausible as a bridge on copied card images or pre-hire packets before those formal checks run.

**Mortgage Lenders / Banks**
**Status Vetting:** Verifying that a borrower is a "Permanent Resident" before granting a 30-year mortgage, as non-resident loans carry significantly higher risk and different interest rates.

**Airlines / Carrier Security**
Official carrier and border systems should remain primary. A verified card copy is only a secondary convenience surface.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Super-Clone" Fraud Problem**

- **Photo Return:** The verification response should include the **USCIS Authoritative Photo**. If the face on the phone doesn't match the face on the plastic card, the card is a clone.
- **Geo-Anomaly Detection:** If a card hash is scanned in New York at 9 AM and Los Angeles at 10 AM, the system flags a "Cloned Identity" in circulation.
- **Category Tampering:** Changing a "Student" visa class to a "Permanent Resident" class on a fake card.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).**
**DHS SAVE System (Backend Source).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Green Card data is subject to the Privacy Act. The hash must be salted to prevent "Enumeration" of the US non-citizen population.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Issues permanent resident cards for non-citizens authorized to live.

```
✓ uscis.gov/greencard/verify — Issues permanent resident cards for non-citizens authorized to live
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

The Green Card is a gold-standard identity artifact, but official immigration and employment systems still sit above any portable copy. Live Verify helps most when a human-readable or copied card needs to bridge back to current USCIS status outside those native systems.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive USCIS's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the document.
