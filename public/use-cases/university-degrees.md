## What is a University Degree?

A **University Degree** (Diploma) is the official credential proving that an individual has completed a specific course of study at an accredited institution. It is the "Master Key" for high-value employment.

Beyond the diploma on the wall, the **Academic Transcript** is the granular record of every class, grade, and credit hour earned.

**"Diploma Mill"** fraud is a multi-billion dollar industry. Criminals create fake universities with real-sounding names or buy high-quality forged diplomas from prestigious schools like Harvard or Oxford for a few hundred dollars. Even more common is **"GPA Inflation,"** where applicants edit their PDF transcripts to turn a "C" in a critical math class into an "A." The strongest architecture is still the university registrar, clearinghouse, or national education-verification system where one already exists. Live Verify is more credible as a bridge when the diploma, transcript PDF, or completion letter is already the artifact in circulation outside those systems.

## Data Verified

Student name, University name, Degree title (e.g., MSc, PhD), Major/Major field of study, Date of graduation, Classification/Honors (e.g., Class I, Summa Cum Laude), Unique Student ID, Registrar signature ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Diploma:** The formal decorative certificate.
- **Academic Transcript:** Detailed semester-by-base report.
- **Letter of Completion:** Temporary proof before the graduation ceremony.
- **Enrollment Verification:** Proving current student status.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Degree is authentic and verified in the registrar's ledger
- **REVOKED** — Degree was withdrawn (e.g., due to plagiarism or ethical violation); do not proceed with hiring
- **WITHHELD** — Graduation requirements met, but degree not released (e.g., unpaid fees)
- **IN_PROGRESS** — Student is currently enrolled and in good standing; not yet graduated
- **404** — Degree not found (never awarded, wrong name, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the diploma itself (e.g., `cam.ac.uk`).

## Post-Verification Actions

None typically. The verification confirms the degree is genuine; that's the value for hiring decisions.

**Why No Further Action:**

- **Hiring managers** just need confirmation the degree is real before extending an offer
- **Immigration authorities** just need status for visa points calculations
- **Licensing boards** just need proof of graduation before allowing exam registration

The status code is the decision point. No POST form or additional workflow needed.

**For Transcript Details:**

If an employer needs the full transcript (GPA, specific courses), that's a separate request to the registrar — not a post-verification action. The diploma verification answers "did they graduate?" not "what grades did they get?"

## Second-Party Use

The **Graduate (Alumnus)** benefits from verification.

**Job Applications:** Proving to a potential employer that a degree or honors classification isn't fabricated. This is strongest when the employer is working from the diploma or transcript artifact before a formal registrar or clearinghouse check completes.

**Global Mobility:** Providing a verified hash to an international visa agency. This removes the need for expensive "Consular Legalization" or "Apostille" of physical diplomas, which can cost $500+ and take months.

## Third-Party Use

**Hiring Managers / HR Teams**
**Fraud Prevention:** Diploma mills sell realistic-looking degrees for any subject. Live Verify connects the recruiter directly to the real university's domain, stopping "Fake Ivy League" fraud at the source.

**Immigration Authorities (UK Home Office / US USCIS)**
**Visa Vetting:** Verifying the points-based qualifications of high-skilled migrants by confirming their degrees match the university's official records.

**Professional Licensing Boards**
**Credentialing:** Ensuring that a candidate for a Medical or Law license has actually graduated from an accredited university before they are allowed to take the board exams.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Diploma Mill" Fraud Problem**

- **Template Forgery:** Using high-end parchment and fake seals to create a "Degree" from a real university for someone who never attended.
- **GPA Tampering:** Editing a 2.5 GPA to 3.9 on a PDF transcript to get into a top-tier MBA program.
- **Major Inflation:** Changing a "Sociology" degree to "Computer Science" to qualify for a technical role.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Universities:** (Hosting on their own `/registrar` or `/verify` domain).
**Ministry of Education:** (In countries with a centralized national degree database).
**Credly / Parchment:** (Digital credential platforms hosting verified hashes).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

```
✓ degree-confirmation.cam.ac.uk/verify — Awards degrees and academic qualifications
  ✓ officeforstudents.org.uk — Regulates English higher education providers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the university registrar's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the degree.


## Competition vs. Education Clearinghouses (NSC)

| Feature | Live Verify | National Student Clearinghouse | Physical Diploma |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the University. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Visual.** |
| **Speed** | **Fast bridge from the artifact.** | **Primary where integrated.** Often takes time. | **Instant.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** Employers pay $15-$50 per check. | **Zero.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds GPA and Honors. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Narrower conclusion:** Registrar and clearinghouse systems should remain primary where they are available and accepted. Live Verify is complementary when the diploma, transcript, or completion letter is already being exchanged outside those systems and the verifier otherwise falls back to PDF trust or visual inspection.
