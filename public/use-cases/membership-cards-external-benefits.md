# Membership Cards with External Benefits

Membership credentials where the primary verification need is **outside** the issuing organization's own premises. These aren't about getting through the club's front door—they're about proving membership to third parties who provide benefits, discounts, or services based on that status.

## Why Live Verify Matters Here

A gym membership card only needs to work at the gym—they have your photo on file. But an **AAA card** needs to convince a tow truck driver at 2am on a highway that you're entitled to free roadside assistance. The driver can't call AAA's membership database. A **professional society ID** needs to convince a conference registration desk that you qualify for the $400 member discount. These are high-trust, low-verification situations ripe for fraud.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

**Examples:** AAA (US), CAA (Canada), RAC/AA (UK), ADAC (Germany), NRMA (Australia)

### Data Verified
**Member Name**, **Member Number**, **Membership Tier** (Basic, Plus, Premier), **Valid Through Date**, **Home Club** (regional affiliate), **Covered Vehicles** (if listed), **Household Members** (if applicable).

### Data Visible After Verification
**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Membership current, benefits available
- **Expired** — Lapsed membership, not entitled to services
- **Suspended** — Account issue (e.g., payment dispute)
- **Tier Confirmed** — Confirms specific tier (matters for tow distance limits)

### Second-Party Use (Member Verifying Their Own Card)
**Pre-Trip Confirmation:** Before a road trip, members verify their card is current and shows the correct tier—discovering an expired card at roadside is too late.
**Household Coverage:** Verifying that spouse/dependent cards are properly linked to the primary membership.

### Third-Party Use

**Tow Truck Operators & Roadside Assistance Contractors**
The primary use case. Contractor arrives at roadside, member presents card. Contractor needs to know: (1) Is this a real AAA member? (2) What tier—how many free tow miles? Verification answers both instantly without calling dispatch.

**Hotels & Car Rental Agencies**
Many offer AAA discounts. Front desk verifies membership before applying 10-15% discount. Currently relies on visual inspection of cards—easily defeated by expired or fake cards.

**Insurance Companies**
Some auto insurers offer discounts for AAA members (assuming safer drivers). Verification confirms active membership for underwriting.

</div>

**Examples:** IEEE, ACM, ASME, ASCE, AMA, ABA, AICPA, RIBA, ICE, AIAA

### Data Verified
**Member Name**, **Member Number**, **Membership Grade** (Student, Member, Senior Member, Fellow), **Society/Division Affiliations**, **Expiration Year**, **Certifications Held** (if applicable).

### Data Visible After Verification
**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Current dues-paid member
- **Expired** — Lapsed membership
- **Life Member** — Permanent status (no expiration)
- **Grade Confirmed** — Verifies claimed grade (Fellow vs. Member matters)
- **Good Standing** — No ethics violations or suspensions

### Second-Party Use (Member Verifying Their Own Card)
**Credential Claims:** Professionals listing "IEEE Senior Member" on resumes can prove the claim is current and accurate.
**CE Tracking:** Verifying membership includes access to continuing education credits.

### Third-Party Use

**Conference Registration Desks**
The $800 non-member rate vs. $400 member rate creates strong incentive for fraud. Registration staff scan the card, verify against `membership.ieee.org`, confirm Senior Member status, apply correct pricing. No more trusting faded cards or expired credentials.

**Employers During Hiring**
Engineering firms value professional society memberships as credentials. HR verifies claimed IEEE Senior Member or ASCE Fellow status during background checks.

**Licensing Boards**
Some PE boards accept professional society membership as evidence of continuing competence. Verification provides documentation.

**Journal Publishers & Digital Libraries**
IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library offer member pricing. Institutional access aside, individual members verify for discounted subscriptions.

**Examples:** Private golf clubs, yacht clubs, city/university clubs, dining clubs

### Data Verified
**Member Name**, **Home Club Name**, **Member Since Date**, **Membership Category** (Full, Social, Junior, etc.), **Good Standing Status**, **Reciprocal Privileges Included**.

### Data Visible After Verification
**Status Indications:**

### Second-Party Use (Member Verifying Their Own Card)
**Pre-Travel Planning:** Before visiting a reciprocal club abroad, verify your home membership is current and includes reciprocal privileges.

### Third-Party Use

**Host Club Staff**
The classic scenario: Member of Winged Foot visits Royal Melbourne in Australia. Royal Melbourne's front desk needs to verify: (1) Is this person actually a Winged Foot member? (2) Are they in good standing? (3) Does their membership category include reciprocal privileges? A phone call to New York at 8am Melbourne time isn't practical. Verification solves this instantly.

**Yacht Club Harbormasters**
Visiting yachts requesting reciprocal mooring privileges. Harbormaster verifies home club membership before allocating dock space.

**City Club Networks**
University clubs, business clubs with reciprocal networks (e.g., the University Club of New York has reciprocals with similar clubs in London, Hong Kong, etc.). Concierge verifies visiting member credentials.

Some career services (job boards, networking events, resume reviews) are restricted to paid alumni association members, not just any graduate. Verification confirms association membership.

**Alumni Event Organizers**
Regional alumni club hosting a networking dinner. Verify attendee is a paid-up association member entitled to member pricing, not just someone who claims to have graduated.

**Partner Discount Programs**
Alumni associations negotiate discounts (insurance, travel, etc.). Vendors verify association membership before applying discounts—being a graduate isn't enough.

### Third-Party Use

**VA Benefit Advocacy**
VFW and American Legion provide accredited representatives for VA claims. Verification confirms member eligibility for these free advocacy services.

**Fraternal Insurance Programs**

**Lodge Visits**
Mason traveling to another jurisdiction presents credentials. Host lodge verifies home lodge membership before admitting to meetings.

**Vendor Discount Programs**
Veterans organization discount programs (hotels, car rentals, retailers). Vendor verifies membership—being a veteran isn't enough; must be an organization member.

---

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Membership organizations issue membership credentials verifying status for external benefit providers. The issuer is self-authorized as the membership authority.

```
✓ membership.nationaltrust.org.uk/verify — Verifies membership status and benefit eligibility
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Common Verification Scenarios

| Scenario | Verifier | What They Need to Confirm |
|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| Roadside breakdown | Tow truck driver | Active membership, service tier |
| Conference registration | Event staff | Member status, grade for discount rate |
| Partner club visit | Host club front desk | Home club membership, good standing |
| Union job dispatch | Hiring hall | Dues-paid status, trade classification |
| Alumni career fair | University staff | Association membership (not just graduation) |
| Hotel discount | Front desk clerk | Current membership, discount eligibility |
| Film set payroll | Production company | SAG-AFTRA status, pay scale eligibility |
| Lodge visit | Host lodge secretary | Home lodge membership, good standing |

## Revocation: Clubs vs. Professional Bodies

An important distinction in how memberships end:

**Clubs & Associations** (AAA, golf clubs, alumni associations, fraternal organizations)
Expulsion is typically discretionary—breaking house rules, unpaid dues, conduct unbecoming. The club's board votes, you're out. Verification returns `EXPELLED` or `SUSPENDED`, but there's no public record or appeal process. You simply lose access to benefits.

**Professional Bodies** (IEEE, ABA, medical societies, unions)
These have formal, quasi-regulatory obligations:
- **Continuing education:** Must complete X credits per year or membership lapses
- **Ethics compliance:** Subject to disciplinary codes with hearings and appeals
- **Dues + assessments:** More than just annual fees—special levies, insurance requirements
- **Public accountability:** Disciplinary actions may be published (lawyers, doctors)
- **Reinstatement procedures:** Formal process to regain standing after lapse or suspension

For professional bodies, verification status carries weight beyond "can they use the discount?" It may indicate: Are they in good standing with their profession? Have they met continuing competence requirements? Is there pending disciplinary action?

**Union memberships** fall somewhere in between—dues-paid status is binary, but trade classifications, apprenticeship completion, and jurisdiction rules add complexity.

---

## Text-to-Hash Suitability

This use case has **two distinct verification modes** with different tooling needs:

**1. In-Person / Point-of-Service (OCR-primary)**
- Tow truck driver verifying AAA card at roadside
- Conference desk checking IEEE membership
- Union hiring hall dispatching members
- Golf club front desk checking reciprocal credentials

These are **physical card + camera/OCR** scenarios. The verifier has the card in hand (or can see it through a window). Text-to-hash isn't practical here — the member doesn't have a laptop open, and the verifier needs instant confirmation.

**2. Remote / Administrative (Text-to-hash primary)**
- HR verifying IEEE Senior Member claim on a resume (candidate emails membership PDF)
- Insurance underwriter confirming AAA membership for discount eligibility
- Conference pre-registration team processing early-bird applications (member emails proof)
- Union pension fund verifying eligibility from submitted documentation
- Hotel booking system accepting membership proof for pre-applied discounts

These are **digital document** scenarios. The verifier receives a PDF, email, or screenshot and can select text with a browser extension.

**Guidance for implementers:**
- For organizations with strong in-person verification needs (AAA, unions, club front desks), invest in OCR/camera tooling
- For organizations where remote/administrative verification dominates (professional societies, alumni associations), text-to-hash browser extensions are sufficient
- Most organizations need both — build for the dominant use case, support the secondary

## The Fake Membership Card Problem

Membership fraud is low-tech and widespread:
- **Counterfeit cards:** Fake AAA cards printed for roadside assistance fraud
- **Expired memberships:** Presenting lapsed credentials for current benefits
- **Tier inflation:** Claiming premium status (AAA Premier, IEEE Fellow) for enhanced benefits
- **Reciprocal abuse:** Fabricating membership at Club A to access Club B's facilities
- **Union card fraud:** Fake credentials to access hiring halls or job sites
- **Discount hunting:** Fake alumni/veterans cards for retail discounts

**The Fix:** Domain binding to the issuing organization. A fake AAA card won't hash to `member.aaa.com`. A lapsed IEEE membership returns `EXPIRED` from `membership.ieee.org`. The tow truck driver, the conference desk, and the partner club can all verify instantly—no phone calls, no waiting.

## Why This Works Better Than Database Lookups

- Many verifiers lack direct database access (tow truck contractors, hotel clerks)
- International reciprocal clubs can't query each other's member databases
- Verification works offline—the card contains everything needed
- The physical card itself becomes the proof—scan it, verify it, done

## Rationale

Unlike venue-admission credentials (where the issuer controls the door), these memberships create value through **distributed third-party recognition**. The AAA tow truck driver, the IEEE conference, the partner yacht club, and the union hiring hall all need to trust the card—but none of them control the membership database. Live Verify bridges this trust gap, turning a paper or plastic card into a cryptographically verifiable credential that works anywhere, anytime, without a phone call.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the membership organization's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (member names, member numbers, membership tiers, membership grades, expiration dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the membership status and benefit eligibility.
