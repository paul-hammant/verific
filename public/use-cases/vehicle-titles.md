## What is a Vehicle Title?

You're buying a used car from a private seller for $28,000. They hand you a title. How do you know it's real? How do you know the car isn't stolen? How do you know there isn't a lien from a bank that still owns half the car? How do you know the title wasn't "washed" — transferred through a lenient state to erase a salvage brand after flood damage?

Right now, you can't know any of this with certainty in a parking lot. You can check online databases, but the title in your hand could be a photocopy, an altered original, or a legitimate title from a state that conveniently erased the salvage history. Title fraud costs US consumers billions annually. Odometer rollbacks alone account for over $1 billion per year. After every major hurricane, thousands of flood-damaged cars get new titles in states that don't carry flood brands, then get sold to unsuspecting buyers hundreds of miles inland.

The strongest architecture is still the issuing DMV or title-registry system, and where issuer QR/direct lookup already exists it should remain primary. Live Verify is more plausible as a bridge when the buyer, lender, or mechanic is working from the paper title itself and needs a direct path back to current DMV status in the field.

## Data Verified

VIN, owner name, title number, state of issuance, title brand (CLEAN / SALVAGE / REBUILT / FLOOD / JUNK), lien holder (if any), odometer reading at title issuance, date issued, year/make/model, body style, color.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Title:** The primary ownership document issued by the state DMV.
- **Duplicate Title:** Replacement for a lost or damaged original.
- **Electronic Title (e-Title):** Digital-only title held by the DMV (some states).
- **Manufacturer's Statement of Origin (MSO):** Pre-title document for new vehicles before first registration.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a status code and key fields:

- **CLEAN** — Valid title, no brands, no liens. Vehicle has a clear history.
- **LIEN** — Valid title but a lien holder has a security interest. Returns lien holder name.
- **SALVAGE** — Vehicle has been declared a total loss by an insurance company.
- **REBUILT** — Previously salvaged vehicle that has been rebuilt and passed state inspection.
- **FLOOD** — Flood damage brand on record.
- **STOLEN** — Vehicle reported stolen. **Critical safety response.** Do not proceed with transaction.
- **SUPERSEDED** — A newer title has been issued. This copy is outdated; ownership has transferred.
- **404** — No matching record. Possible forgery, wrong state, or OCR error.

## Second-Party Use

The **Vehicle Owner** (second party) benefits from verification:

**Private Sale Confidence:** Proving to a buyer that you actually own the car, it has a clean title, and there are no liens. No more "let me call my bank to confirm the lien was released" — the buyer scans and sees it immediately.

**Insurance Claims:** After an accident or theft, proving ownership to the insurance company without mailing original documents or waiting for DMV business hours.

**Refinancing:** Proving to a new lender that the existing lien has been released, enabling faster loan processing.

**Theft Recovery:** After a stolen vehicle is recovered, proving ownership to law enforcement on the spot.

## Third-Party Use

**Private Buyers (The Parking Lot Scenario)**
The primary use case. Before handing over cash or a cashier's check, the buyer scans the title and confirms: real title, correct VIN, correct owner standing in front of them, no liens, no salvage brands, no theft report. Five seconds of verification replaces hours of anxious database searching and phone calls.

**Used Car Dealers**
Verifying titles on trade-ins before accepting them. Catching washed titles before they enter dealer inventory and create liability.

**Auto Lenders (Banks, Credit Unions, Finance Companies)**
Lien verification before financing. Confirming no prior liens exist, confirming the seller actually holds the title, confirming the VIN matches the vehicle being financed.

**Insurance Companies**
Total loss verification — confirming a vehicle was actually salvaged before paying out. Theft claims — confirming the claimant is the titled owner. Fraud detection — cross-referencing title brands with claim history.

**Law Enforcement**
Stolen vehicle checks during traffic stops or investigations. VIN verification at checkpoints. Confirming ownership during disputes or impound situations.

**State DMVs (Interstate Title Transfers)**
When a vehicle is titled in a new state, the receiving DMV can verify the surrendered out-of-state title is genuine. This is the key defense against title washing — the receiving state can see the full brand history, not just what's printed on the paper.

**Mechanics and Body Shops**
Checking for salvage brands before agreeing to expensive repairs. A customer bringing in a "clean" car for $8,000 in body work that turns out to be a flood-damaged salvage is a liability nightmare.

## Verification Architecture

**The Title Fraud Problem**

Title fraud is not a single attack — it's a family of related schemes, all of which exploit the same weakness: paper titles are easy to forge or manipulate, and there's no real-time way for a consumer to verify them.

- **Title Washing:** The big one. A car is totaled in Florida and branded SALVAGE. The fraudster titles it in a state with weaker branding laws (or one that doesn't carry over out-of-state brands), and the salvage history disappears. The car gets a CLEAN title and is sold to an unsuspecting buyer at full market value. Post-hurricane, this happens at industrial scale.
- **VIN Cloning:** A stolen car is given the VIN of a clean, legally owned car of the same make and model. The thief creates a forged title matching the cloned VIN. The buyer thinks they're getting a legitimate car; they're buying stolen property.
- **Lien Stripping:** Seller has a $15,000 loan on the car but presents a title showing no lien (forged or from before the lien was recorded). Buyer pays the seller, bank still owns the car, bank repossesses the car from the buyer.
- **Odometer Rollback:** A car with 120,000 miles gets its odometer rolled back to 40,000. The verified odometer reading at title issuance serves as a check — if the title says 95,000 miles at last transfer but the odometer now reads 40,000, something is very wrong.
- **Forged Titles:** Entirely fabricated documents. High-quality printing makes this easier than ever. Without real-time verification, a buyer is comparing the paper to their mental model of what a title "should look like."
- **Curbstoning:** Unlicensed dealers posing as private sellers, flipping cars with forged or washed titles. They buy salvage cars cheaply, do cosmetic repairs, wash the title, and sell at clean-title prices. Live Verify makes every title checkable, removing the information asymmetry curbstoners depend on.
- **Flood Car Laundering:** After every major hurricane (Harvey, Ian, Helene), thousands of flood-damaged cars are bought at salvage auctions, dried out, detailed, and titled in states that don't carry flood brands. Buyers in landlocked states have no idea they're buying a car whose electronics will fail in six months.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State DMVs:** The sole issuing authority for vehicle titles within each state. Each of the 50 US states (plus DC and territories) operates its own titling system.
**DVLA (UK):** The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency issues V5C registration certificates.
**Equivalent Agencies:** (Transport Canada, DVSA, state-level agencies in Germany, Australia, etc.)

## Privacy Salt

Moderate. VINs are semi-public — they're visible through the windshield on the dashboard plate, printed on insurance cards, and recorded in service records. But linking a VIN to an owner's name and address is sensitive information. Without salting, an attacker could enumerate VINs (they follow a predictable format) and build a database of who owns what vehicle and where they live. The salt prevents this "VIN-to-owner" enumeration attack while still allowing verification when you have the actual title document in hand.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

The DVLA issues UK vehicle titles and registration certificates under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994.

```
✓ dvla.gov.uk/v5c/verify — DVLA vehicle title and registration certificate service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition vs. Existing Title Verification Methods

| Feature | Live Verify | NMVTIS | Carfax / AutoCheck | Calling the DMV | Trusting the Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accessible to Consumers** | **Potentially yes, when working from the title in hand.** | **No.** Available to dealers and approved entities only. Consumers cannot query directly. | **Yes.** But it's a paid third-party report. | **Barely.** Business hours, long hold times, limited info by phone. | **Yes.** But meaningless without verification. |
| **Real-Time** | **Yes.** Instant response from issuing DMV. | **No.** Batch-updated; can lag weeks behind actual title events. | **No.** Depends on data feeds from insurers, shops, auctions. Gaps are common. | **No.** Minutes to hours, if they answer at all. | **N/A.** |
| **Authoritative** | **Yes.** If it resolves to the issuing DMV. | **Partially.** Federal aggregation of state data, but not all states participate fully. | **No.** Third-party compilation. Misses states, misses events, misses flood brands from certain jurisdictions. | **Yes.** But getting the info is the problem. | **No.** Paper can be forged. |
| **Catches Title Washing** | **Yes.** Receiving state can verify the surrendered title's brand history at the source. | **Partially.** Only if both states report fully. | **Sometimes.** Known gaps in flood/salvage brand reporting. | **Maybe.** If you call the right state and ask the right questions. | **No.** That's the entire point of washing. |
| **Catches Stolen Vehicles** | **Yes.** STOLEN status returned immediately. | **Yes.** This is NMVTIS's strongest feature. | **Sometimes.** Depends on when theft was reported and data lag. | **Yes.** But slow. | **No.** |
| **Cost to Consumer** | **Free.** The verification is a GET request. | **Not available to consumers.** | **$25-50 per report.** | **Free but costly in time.** | **Free.** |

**Narrower conclusion:** The registry remains the source of truth. This is strongest only where the relying party is in the field with the paper title and lacks a practical direct registry workflow. In that situation, the title becomes a bridge to DMV status rather than the core trust architecture by itself.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen — which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (VIN, title number, brand status, dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail — available to the jurisdiction on demand, to title holders during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** DMV cannot deny issuing the title
- **Timestamp proof:** Title existed at a specific time with a specific brand status
- **Regulatory audit:** Federal agencies (NHTSA, DOJ) can inspect witness ledgers for title washing patterns across states
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if the issuing DMV's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuing state DMV
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Further Derivations

1. **Boat / Watercraft Titles** — Similar ownership-and-brand structure, different registries. US Coast Guard for documented vessels, state DNR (Department of Natural Resources) for smaller craft. Hull Identification Numbers (HIN) instead of VINs. Same title washing problem exists — hurricane-damaged boats titled in lenient states.
2. **Aircraft Titles** — FAA Aircraft Registry (N-number registration) for US civil aircraft, international civil aviation registries (ICAO member states) for foreign-registered aircraft. Higher value per unit, more complex lien structures, international ownership common.
