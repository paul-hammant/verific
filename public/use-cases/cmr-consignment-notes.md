## What is a CMR Waybill?

In European and Asian trucking, the **CMR Consignment Note** is the standard contract for road freight. It follows the truck from the factory in Berlin to the store in Paris.

It is the "Proof of Handoff." It records:
1.  **What is on the truck:** (e.g., 12 pallets of electronics).
2.  **The condition:** Did the driver note any broken boxes at pickup?
3.  **The Delivery:** The customer signs it when the truck arrives.

Trucking is a fragmented industry. Verified CMRs prevent "Weight Fraud" (lying about how heavy the truck is to avoid tolls) and "Phantom Shipments" (faking deliveries to get paid for work never done).

## Data Verified

Consignment number, Sender name, Consignee name, Pickup/Delivery locations, cargo description, number of packages, gross weight, Carrier ID, date of taking over, specialized instructions (e.g., "Keep Dry").

**Document Types:**
- **Standard CMR Note:** For international road transport (CMR Convention).
- **Domestic Waybill:** For within-country trucking.
- **Delivery Receipt (POD):** Signed by the receiver.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Carrier or Freight Forwarder) and current cargo status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Collected** — Goods are on the truck; driver has signed.
- **In-Transit** — Moving through hubs or across borders.
- **Delivered** — Handed over to consignee; signed POD uploaded.
- **Exception** — Damage or shortage reported at delivery.

## Second-Party Use

The **Sender (Shipper)** benefits from verification.

**Payment Trigger:** Proving to a customer that the goods were "Verified Taken Over" by a reputable carrier (e.g., DHL or Kuehne+Nagel). This allows the shipper to issue their invoice with confidence.

**Dispute Defense:** If the receiver claims the goods arrived damaged, the shipper can point to the "Verified Clean" taking-over note to prove the carrier accepted the goods in good condition.

## Third-Party Use

**Customs Authorities (Cross-Border)**
**Security Check:** Border agents can scan the CMR while the truck is in the queue. "Verified by Carrier" ensures the paper doesn't hide "Phantom Cargo" or mislabeled hazardous goods.

**Insurance Companies**
**Liability Claims:** When a truck crashes, the insurer needs to know exactly what was on board. Verification prevents the shipper and carrier from "colluding" to change the cargo description to a more expensive item after the accident.

**Factoring Companies**
**Invoice Financing:** Banks that buy trucking invoices (factoring) verify the CMR to ensure the shipment is real before advancing cash to the trucking company.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Tailgate" Fraud Problem**

- **Weight Fraud:** Declaring 1,000kg on the CMR but actually carrying 5,000kg to avoid "Overweight" fines or tolls.
- **Phantom Shipments:** Creating fake CMRs to get cash from a factoring bank for work never performed.
- **Damage Concealment:** Drivers altering the "Taking Over" note to add a damage remark after they accidentally dropped a pallet.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Trucking Carriers:** (DHL, DB Schenker, DSV).
**Logistics Marketplaces:** (Sennder, Uber Freight).
**National Road Transport Assocs:** (e.g., IRU - International Road Transport Union).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Freight carriers issue CMR consignment notes as the primary shipper-carrier contract. Self-authorized by their legal status as international road transport operators under CMR convention.

```
✓ transport.dhl.com/cmr/verify — Issues CMR consignment notes and freight documentation
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the transport operator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (shipment number, routing, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.

## Competition vs. e-CMR (Digital Convention)

| Feature | Live Verify | e-CMR (Standard) | Paper Carbon Copy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Connectivity** | **Strong.** Paper works in the mountains/tunnels. | **Fragile.** Requires app + 5G at every handoff. | **Offline.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Carrier. | **Protocol-Bound.** Trust the UN convention system. | **Visual.** Trusted only via stamp. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any trucker with a URL. | **Low.** Requires all countries to ratify the e-Protocol. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Data.** Protects the Weight/Count. | **Digital Only.** | **Zero.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Front Line" reality. Trucking is a rugged, fragmented industry with millions of independent drivers. Getting every driver in Europe on a single e-CMR app is a 20-year project. Live Verify turns the **Existing Paper Standard** into a digital artifact *today*, providing 90% of the benefits of e-CMR with 0% of the friction.
