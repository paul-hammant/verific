## What is an FFL License?

In the USA, you cannot sell firearms as a business without a **Federal Firearms License (FFL)** from the ATF.

This license is the "Security Key" for the entire industry. If a dealer in Texas wants to ship a rifle to a buyer in New York, the law **requires** them to ship it to another FFL dealer. Before shipping, the Texas dealer must verify the New York dealer's license is real.

Scammers often create fake FFL PDF papers to trick online sellers into shipping guns directly to their homes (illegal "Ghost Dealing"). Verified hashes allow any seller to scan the license and see the "ACTIVE" status on the `atf.gov` domain in seconds.

## Data Verified

Licensee name, trade name (DBA), premises address, mailing address, FFL number (full 15-digit), license type (01-11), expiration date, responsible person ID, issuing ATF region.

**Document Types:**
- **Federal Firearms License (FFL):** The primary paper license for the shop wall.
- **FFL Extract:** For shipping to other dealers.
- **SOT Certificate:** Special Occupational Taxpayer (for silencers/machine guns).
- **ATF Inspection Report:** (Linked hash) proving a successful compliance audit.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`atf.gov`) and current regulatory standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — License is valid; dealer is authorized to trade.
- **Suspended** — Temporary restriction (e.g., due to record-keeping errors).
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from firearms trade (High-risk).
- **Expired** — Renewal application not received.

## Second-Party Use

The **FFL Holder (Gun Shop Owner)** benefits from verification.

**Interstate Shipping:** Proving to a different dealer in another state that their FFL is "Verified Active." This is a mandatory requirement before shipping any firearm across state lines. A verified hash replaces the "Manual FFL EzCheck" website lookup, reducing friction in the $30B firearms market.

**Lender / Banking:** Proving to a high-risk payment processor or bank that the business is a verified, federally licensed entity, preventing account freezes.

## Third-Party Use

**Law Enforcement (ATF / State Police)**
**Audit Efficiency:** During a surprise ATF inspection, the agent can scan the wall license. "Verified by ATF.gov" ensures the shop isn't using a "Homemade License" to hide an illegal operation.

**Private Gun Sellers (Private Citizens)**
**Person-to-Person Transfers:** Before shipping a rifle to a dealer for a buyer, a citizen can verify the dealer's FFL hash. This ensures they aren't mailing a weapon to a "Fake Dealer" or a felon with a color printer.

**Shipping Carriers (FedEx / UPS)**
**Authorization:** Verifying the FFL status of a shipper before accepting hazardous/regulated firearms cargo for transport.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Dealer" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Licenses:** Felons creating fake FFL documents to trick online sellers into shipping guns directly to their homes.
- **Expired Display:** A dealer whose license was revoked for "Straw Purchasing" continuing to use their unexpired paper license to trade illegally.
- **Address Swapping:** Taking a valid FFL for a secure shop and using it to run an illegal warehouse at a different, un-vetted location.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF):** The sole federal issuer.
**State Departments of Public Safety:** (In states with secondary licensing).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. FFL data is protected by various federal laws (e.g., Tiahrt Amendment). The hash must be salted to prevent "Mass Mapping" of all gun shops in a state by bad actors.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Issues federal firearms dealer licenses for lawful commerce.

```
✓ atf.gov/ffl/verify — Issues federal firearms dealer licenses for lawful commerce
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the ATF's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (FFL numbers, license types, expiration dates, responsible person IDs, issuing ATF regions) — never licensed dealer premises addresses or details identifying protected federal facilities — providing non-repudiation of the license and an audit trail state law enforcement can inspect.

## Competition vs. ATF FFL EzCheck

| Feature | Live Verify | FFL EzCheck (Web) | Paper License |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `atf.gov`. | **Database.** Direct from source. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires typing 15 digits into a web form. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Photo/Signer.** Protects every word. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the paper. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Mobile Use** | **High.** Built for phones. | **Low.** Web form is hard to use on mobile. | **High.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Shipping Counter" reality. Gun owners and dealers are often at shipping docks or gun shows where they need to verify credentials *now*. Live Verify turns the **Physical License** into a live, high-speed digital credential, bringing federal-level security to the point of transfer.
