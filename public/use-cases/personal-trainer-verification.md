## What is Trainer Verification?

When you hire a **Personal Trainer** or **Yoga Instructor**, you are often alone with them in a private gym, a park, or your own home. You are trusting them with your physical safety and, in some cases, your personal security.

The problem is that "Fitness Certification" is an unregulated industry in many regions. Anyone can print a realistic-looking "Certified Trainer" certificate at home. Even legitimate trainers may have had their certifications revoked for safety violations or failed their background checks.

Live Verify allows a client to scan the trainer's digital badge or physical ID to verify: **"Is this person currently certified by a recognized national body, and have they passed a professional background check?"**

## Data Verified

Trainer name, certification ID number, credential type (CPT, Nutrition, etc.), expiration date, issuing body (NASM, ACE, ISSA), liability insurance status, background check timestamp, CPR/AED certification status.

**Document Types:**
- **Digital Professional Badge:** Carried on a smartphone.
- **Physical ID Card:** Worn in a gym setting.
- **Certificate of Insurance (COI):** (Linked hash) proving coverage for injury claims.
- **Background Check Result:** Proof of vetting for home visits.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`nasm.org`, `acefitness.org`, `equinox.com`) and the professional status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Certified** — Trainer is in good standing and meet all requirements.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Credentials temporarily revoked (e.g., due to reported injury incident).
- **Expired** — Mandatory re-certification or insurance renewal is overdue.
- **Background Flag** — **CRITICAL:** Background check has expired or a new issue was reported.

## Second-Party Use

The **Client / Gym Member** benefits from verification.

**One-on-One Safety:** Before allowing a new trainer into their home, a client scans the digital badge. If it returns **"ACTIVE - BACKGROUND CHECK CLEAR,"** they can proceed with the session. If it returns **"EXPIRED,"** they avoid the risk of hiring an un-vetted stranger.

**Insurance Claims:** If a client is injured during a session, they can use the verified hash of the trainer's "Verified Status" to prove they did their due diligence in hiring a certified professional when filing a claim with their own insurer.

## Third-Party Use

**Luxury Gyms / Health Clubs**
**Sub-contractor Vetting:** High-end gyms (e.g., Equinox) allow independent trainers to bring clients to their facilities. Live Verify allows the gym's front desk to instantly verify that every guest trainer is currently certified and insured, protecting the gym from liability.

**Marketplaces (e.g., Thumbtack, Bark)**
**Merchant Integrity:** Service platforms can require trainers to provide a verified hash. This allows the platform to automatically "De-list" trainers whose certifications expire, ensuring that users only see verified pros.

**Insurance Underwriters**
**Risk Pricing:** Insurers providing professional liability to trainers can offer lower rates to those who maintain a 100% "Verified Active" status on their profiles.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Weekend Workshop" Fraud Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** People buying fake "NASM Certificates" online to bypass hiring requirements.
- **Status Masking:** Continuing to use a "Certified" label after a license was revoked for unprofessional conduct.
- **Insurance Ghosting:** Presenting a 2-year-old COI as if it were currently active.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Certification Bodies.**
**National Registries (e.g., USREPS).**
**Large Corporate Gym Chains (Internal Vetting).**

**Privacy Salt:** Medium. While certification status is public, individual background check details are private. The hash must be salted to prevent "Stalking" or harassment of individual trainers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

CIMSPA certifies personal trainers and fitness professionals in the UK.

```
✓ trainer.cimspa.co.uk — Issues personal trainer certifications
  ✓ cimspa.co.uk — Accredits UK fitness professionals
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Personal training is a "High-Touch, Low-Oversight" service. By turning professional badges into verifiable digital bridges, we create a "Shield of Safety" that protects clients and rewards the dedicated professionals who maintain their standards.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the certification body's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (trainer name, credential type, certification ID, expiration date, insurance and background check status) — never personal background information — providing non-repudiation of trainer credential issuance.
