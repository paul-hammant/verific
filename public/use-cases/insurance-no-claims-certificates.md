## What is a No Claims Certificate?

A No Claims Certificate (also called No Claims Bonus/NCB, No Claims Discount/NCD, or Claims-Free Certificate) proves that a policyholder has not made any claims against their insurance policy for a specified period. This claims-free history entitles them to significant premium discounts, often 50-75% after 5+ years.

The certificate is essential when switching insurers, as the new insurer needs verified proof of claims history to apply the discount. Fraud is common: fake certificates claiming more years of claims-free driving than actually earned, or hiding claims that were made.

## Data Verified

Insurer name, policy number, policyholder name, coverage type, claims-free years earned, last claim date (if any), policy period, protection status, certificate issue date.

**Document Types:**
- **No Claims Bonus Certificate:** Standard NCB/NCD proof for motor insurance.
- **Claims-Free Letter:** General claims history for any insurance type.
- **Protected NCB Certificate:** Shows NCB protection status and terms.
- **International Claims History:** For drivers moving between countries.
- **Fleet Driver Claims Record:** Individual driver history within a fleet policy.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`directline.com`, `admiral.com`) and claims status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Certificate is current and claims history accurate.
- **Expired** — Coverage period ended, may need updated certificate.
- **Claim Filed** — Claim has been made since certificate issued.
- **Reduced** — NCB reduced due to recent claim.
- **Protected** — NCB protected despite fault claim.

## Second-Party Use

The **Policyholder** benefits from verification.

**Switching Insurers:** When getting quotes from new insurers, verified NCB certificates enable immediate discount application without waiting for manual verification.

**Premium Disputes:** If a new insurer claims they couldn't verify the NCB and charged full premium, verified certificates provide irrefutable proof.

**Claims Protection:** After a claim, verified pre-claim NCB status proves the policyholder was entitled to protection benefits.

**International Moves:** Drivers relocating between countries can prove their claims-free history to foreign insurers.

## Third-Party Use

**New Insurers**
**Underwriting:** When onboarding new customers, insurers verify NCB certificates to apply appropriate discounts and assess risk.

**Price Comparison Sites**
**Quote Accuracy:** Comparison platforms can verify NCB claims in real-time to ensure accurate quotes.

**Insurance Brokers**
**Customer Service:** Brokers placing coverage can instantly verify claims history rather than waiting for manual confirmation.

**Fleet Managers**
**Driver Assessment:** When adding drivers to fleet policies, managers verify individual claims histories.

**Motor Finance Companies**
**Risk Assessment:** Lenders on vehicle finance verify insurance history as part of affordability checks.

## Verification Architecture

**The NCB Fraud Problem**

- **Years Inflation:** Claiming 9 years NCB when only 3 years earned.
- **Claims Hiding:** Omitting recent claims to preserve full discount.
- **Policy Invention:** Entirely fake certificates from non-existent insurers.
- **Identity Fraud:** Using another person's claims-free history.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Motor Insurers:** (Direct Line, Admiral, GEICO, Progressive) issue NCB certificates.
**Home Insurers:** (State Farm, Allstate, Aviva) issue claims-free letters.
**Brokers:** Some brokers issue certificates on behalf of underlying insurers.
**MIB (Motor Insurers Bureau):** Central database for UK claims history.

**NCB Protection**

Many policies offer "protected" NCB that survives one or two fault claims. The protection status is important information that should be included in verified certificates.

**Cross-Border Recognition**

NCB earned in one country may be recognized by insurers in another. Verified certificates from the original insurer help foreign insurers trust the claims history.

**Expiry Considerations**

NCB typically expires if not used within 2 years of policy end. Certificates should indicate both the earning period and the expiry date of the NCB entitlement.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Admiral Group, a regulated motor insurer, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified no claims bonus certificates and claims-free history records.

```
✓ noclaims.admiral.co.uk/verify — Issues verified no claims bonus certificates
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurance company's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policyholder name, policy number, vehicle/coverage class, claims-free years, policy period, certificate date) — never plaintext coverage details — providing non-repudiation of the no claims certificate.
