## What is a Visa Extension Approval?

When a person in the US on a temporary visa (e.g., H-1B, F-1, or B-2) wants to stay longer or switch to a different visa type, they file a **Change of Status (COS)** or **Extension of Stay (EOS)**. The approval arrives as an **I-797A Notice of Action**, often with a new paper I-94 attached at the bottom.

These documents are the "Proof of Legal Presence." Fraud is rampant: people whose extensions were denied often "edit" a 2024 approval into a 2026 approval to hide their illegal overstay and trick employers or landlords into believing they are still in status. But the strongest answer is still the official USCIS/CBP/SAVE workflow where available. Live Verify is only credible as a bridge when a relying party is holding the paper notice or PDF outside that native government system.

</div>

## Data Verified

Receipt number (e.g., WAC/LIN/EAC), petitioner/employer name, beneficiary name, case type (I-129/I-539), notice date, approval dates (start/end), new visa class (e.g., H-1B, O-1, L-1), I-94 number (linked), issuing office ID.

**Document Types:**
- **I-797A Notice of Action:** (With I-94) The primary approval for those in the US.
- **I-797B Notice of Action:** (Without I-94) Approval for those abroad.
- **Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Record:** (Linked hash) the underlying stay record.
- **SEVIS Form I-20:** (Linked hash) for students extending their program.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uscis.gov`) and the real-time case standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved / Active** — The extension is valid and the subject is in legal status.
- **Case Reopened** — **ALERT:** The approval is under post-decision review.
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** The approval has been cancelled (e.g., due to job loss or fraud).
- **Unknown** — **CRITICAL:** Hash not found; high risk of a "Synthetic Notice" forgery.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employee (Beneficiary)** benefits from verification.

**Employment Onboarding (I-9):** The strongest production path is still the official employer-verification workflow. Live Verify is more plausible when HR is holding only the approval notice or PDF and needs a lighter bridge back to current government status.

**Driver's License Renewal:** DMVs require proof of legal stay to renew a Real ID. A bridge from the notice to current status may help when staff are working from the notice itself, but SAVE or other direct government checks should remain primary.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers / HR Managers**
**Zero-Trust Vetting:** Thousands of fake I-797s are sold globally every year. The official government workflow should remain primary; Live Verify is only the portability layer when the document itself is what is circulating.

**Landlords / Leasing Agents**
**Eligibility Check:** Verifying that a non-citizen applicant has the verified legal status to remain in the US for the duration of a 12-month lease.

**International Travel Checkpoints**
**Boarding Prep:** This is only defensible as an edge-case bridge from the paper notice to current status. Carrier-facing government document systems should remain dominant.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Date Stretch" Fraud Problem**

- **Validity Inflation:** Changing a 2024 expiration date to 2027 on a PDF to hide an overstay.
- **Class Swapping:** Editing a "B-2" (Tourist - No Work) notice into an "H-1B" (Worker) notice.
- **Notice Fabrication:** Creating a fake "Approval Notice" for a case that was actually denied.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).**
**DHS SAVE System (Backend Source).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Case numbers and names are protected under the Privacy Act. The hash must be salted to prevent "Case Scraping" by unauthorized data brokers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Approves visa extensions and changes of immigration status.

```
✓ uscis.gov/extension/verify — Approves visa extensions and changes of immigration status
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Visa extensions are important status artifacts, but they should not displace official USCIS/CBP/SAVE channels. The narrower claim is that when a notice or PDF is already traveling outside those systems, a direct bridge back to issuer status is better than trusting the paper alone.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive USCIS's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (receipt number, notice date, approval dates, visa class) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the visa extension approval.
