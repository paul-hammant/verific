## What is a Take Permit?

If a construction project (like a new solar farm) is built in a habitat where an endangered animal lives (like the Desert Tortoise), they might accidentally harm or kill some individuals. By law, they must get an **Incidental Take Permit**.

This permit is a "Contract with the Earth." It says: "You are allowed to harm 15 tortoises, but in exchange, you must spend $1 million restoring 400 acres of habitat elsewhere."

"Poaching and Paving" is a real risk: unscrupulous developers often "Edit" their permits to increase the allowed kill limit to avoid the cost of new mitigation. Verified hashes ensure the crew in the field is following the **exact legal limit** set by federal biologists.

## Data Verified

Permittee name, project location, authorized species (Latin/Common name), take limit (numerical), mitigation requirements, effective/expiration dates, HCP (Habitat Conservation Plan) reference, issuing agency (FWS/NOAA).

**Document Types:**
- **Incidental Take Permit (ITP):** Under ESA Section 10.
- **Scientific Research Permit:** For capturing/tagging animals.
- **Enhancement of Survival Permit:** For conservation work.
- **BiOp (Biological Opinion):** (Linked hash) for federal agency actions.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`fws.gov`, `noaa.gov`) and current permit status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Permit is valid; project is authorized.
- **Suspended** — Work stopped (e.g., due to mitigation failure).
- **Exceeded** — **ALERT:** Take limit has been reached; work must stop.
- **Expired** — Permit lapsed; unauthorized take is a federal crime.

## Second-Party Use

The **Permittee (Developer / Researcher)** benefits from verification.

**Compliance Shield:** Proving to a suspicious environmental NGO or a local park ranger that the "Desert Tortoise" they just moved was authorized under a verified federal permit. This prevents immediate project shutdowns and legal threats.

**Lender Requirements:** Proving to an ESG-conscious lender that the project has all verified environmental permits in place before capital is released.

## Third-Party Use

**Environmental Inspectors / Rangers**
**Field Enforcement:** An inspector in a remote desert location can scan the paper permit held by the work crew. "Verified by fws.gov" ensures the crew isn't using a "Photoshopped" permit to destroy habitat for an illegal expansion.

**Concerned Citizens / NGOs**
**Transparency:** Allowing the public to verify the *actual* authorized take limits for a project, ensuring that the "Transparency" promised by the Endangered Species Act is cryptographically real.

**Insurance Carriers**
**Pollution/Liability Underwriting:** Verifying that a construction project is operating within its environmental permits to prevent massive fines and legal liabilities.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Poaching and Paving" Fraud Problem**

- **Species Swapping:** Taking a permit issued for a "Least Concern" species and editing the PDF to cover a "Critically Endangered" one.
- **Limit Inflation:** Changing a "Take Limit of 2" to "20" to avoid the cost of more extensive mitigation.
- **Location Fraud:** Using a permit for a low-risk site to cover an illegal project in a high-risk "Critical Habitat" zone.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS).**
**NOAA Fisheries:** (For marine species).
**State Wildlife Agencies:** (In some jurisdictions).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Permit locations can pinpoint rare species locations, attracting illegal poachers. The hash must be salted to prevent "Species Mapping" attacks.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Fish and wildlife agencies hold statutory authority under endangered species law to issue take permits and conservation authorizations.

```
✓ permits.naturalengland.org.uk/verify — Issues incidental take permits and wildlife authorizations
```

Self-authorized — this is a sovereign body whose authority derives from statute.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the Fish and Wildlife Service's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (permit number, permittee name, location, authorized species, take limit, mitigation requirements, permit expiration date) — never plaintext project details — providing non-repudiation of the take permit.


## Competition vs. ECOS Database

| Feature | Live Verify | ECOS / FWS Public Portal | Paper Permit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the job-site. | **Difficult.** Requires navigating complex gov search forms on mobile in remote areas. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `fws.gov`. | **Database.** High trust but manual. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Mitigation.** Protects the text. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the paper. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Offline Proof** | **Strong.** The paper is the anchor. | **None.** Requires high-speed data. | **Medium.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Remote Site" reality. Endangered species habitat is often in "Dead Zones" without reliable 5G. Live Verify turns the **Physical Permit** into a live, trusted safety link that works anywhere there is a phone camera, protecting the most vulnerable parts of our ecosystem.
