## What is a Data Sharing Agreement?

When universities or hospitals share sensitive data (like DNA sequences or patient records) for research, they sign a **Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)**.

This contract is the "Legal Firewall." It says: "You can use this data for cancer research, but you are **not** allowed to sell it or try to identify the people in it."

Ethics violations are common: researchers sometimes use data for a different purpose than they promised. Verified hashes allow compliance officers to verify the **exact authorized use** of a dataset, protecting patient privacy across international borders.

## Data Verified

Provider institution name, Recipient institution name, Dataset ID/Title, specific Authorized Use (Scope), execution date, termination/expiration date, data protection status (e.g., GDPR compliant), authorized signatories.

**Document Types:**
- **Data Sharing Agreement (DSA):** The primary legal contract.
- **Material Transfer Agreement (MTA):** For biological/physical samples.
- **Data Use Certification (DUC):** For individual researchers.
- **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA):** (Linked hash) proving risk review.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ox.ac.uk`, `stanford.edu`) and agreement status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Agreement is fully executed and in effect.
- **Expired** — Data use period has ended; data must be destroyed.
- **Revoked** — Permission pulled due to a security breach or misuse.
- **Amended** — Replaced by a newer version (e.g., scope expanded).

## Second-Party Use

The **Data Recipient** (Researcher) benefits from verification.

**Grant Funding:** Proving to a funding agency (e.g., NIH or Wellcome Trust) that they have "Verified Legal Access" to the necessary dataset. This prevents delays in grant disbursement.

**Publication Integrity:** Providing a verified link to the DSA in a published paper, proving the research was conducted under an official, institutional agreement.

## Third-Party Use

**University Compliance Officers**
**Portfolio Audit:** Instantly verifying that all outgoing datasets are covered by active, non-expired agreements. Live Verify allows for a "Digital Census" of physical/PDF legal files.

**GDPR / Privacy Regulators**
**Chain of Custody:** If a data breach occurs, regulators can verify the "Authorized Use" and "Restrictions" of the original agreement to determine which party is liable.

**Collaborating Journals**
**Ethical Review:** Ensuring that the authors of a study had the legal right to use the data before publishing the results.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Data Misuse" Fraud Problem**

- **Scope Creep:** A researcher having a DSA for "Diabetes Research" but using the data for "Insurance Modeling" (a common ethics violation).
- **Unauthorized Transfers:** A recipient sharing the data with a third-party company without the provider's knowledge.
- **Fabricated DSAs:** Creating a fake agreement PDF to bypass institutional IRB (Ethics Board) review.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Universities / Research Institutes:** (Oxford, Stanford, Max Planck).
**Medical Centers / Biobanks.**
**Tech Platforms:** (e.g., Vivli, Sage Bionetworks - who host shared data).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. DSAs often involve sensitive health or genetic data labels. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for specific clinical trial involvements.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Research institutions document legal agreements for sharing research data.

```
✓ dsa.ukri.org/verify — Manages UK research data sharing agreements
  ✓ ico.org.uk — Regulates UK data protection and information rights
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the data controller's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the data sharing agreement.
## Competition vs. CLM Systems (Ironclad)

| Feature | Live Verify | CLM (Contract Lifecycle Mgmt) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the University. | **System-Bound.** Trust the CLM vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** PDFs work across institutions. | **Low.** Hard to verify if you don't use the same CLM. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Scope.** Protects the "Authorized Use" text. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Enterprise software fees. | **None.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Institutional Handoff." Oxford uses one system, Stanford uses another. They don't want to grant each other access to their private legal systems. Live Verify turns the **Final Signed PDF** into a portable, verifiable artifact that works across the "Institutional Divide" without any software integration.
