## What is a Robo-Advisor Statement?

In the modern fintech world, **Robo-Advisors** (like Betterment, Wealthfront, or Acorns) manage billions in automated investments. A **Portfolio Statement** is the monthly or quarterly record of an investor's net worth, asset allocation, and performance.

These digital-first documents are the "Proof of Wealth" for a new generation of investors. Fraud is high-frequency: individuals use "Inspect Element" or PDF editors to turn a $5,000 "emergency fund" into a $250,000 "investment portfolio" to qualify for a high-limit credit card or a mortgage. Verified hashes bind the **Net Account Value, Asset Mix, and Client ID** to the advisor's domain (e.g., `betterment.com` or `wealthfront.com`).

## Data Verified

Client name, account number (masked), net portfolio value, asset allocation mix (Stocks/Bonds/Cash), time-weighted performance (TWR), dividend income, tax-loss harvesting amount, advisor CRD/SEC ID, date of statement, specific ticker holdings (top 5).

**Document Types:**
- **Monthly Investment Statement:** The primary wealth record.
- **Tax Report (1099-B/DIV):** (Linked hash) for IRS compliance.
- **Account Opening Confirmation:** Proof of initial funding.
- **Wealth Certificate:** For high-net-worth "Private Client" access.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`betterment.com`, `wealthfront.com`, `acorns.com`) and the account standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Active** — Portfolio value matches the live brokerage record.
- **In-Transfer** — **ALERT:** Assets are being moved to a different advisor (ACATS).
- **Fraud Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The account has been flagged for suspicious PII changes.
- **Closed** — **ALERT:** The account has been liquidated since this statement was issued.

## Second-Party Use

The **Investor (Client)** benefits from verification.

**Mortgage Approval Speed:** When applying for a loan, the investor provides the verified hash of their "Robo Portfolio." The bank can instantly see **"VERIFIED LIQUIDITY: $142,500"** from a trusted firm like Betterment, removing the 3-day "Bank Statement Review" delay and speeding up the home-buying process.

**Visa / Residency Proof:** For high-skilled migrants or digital nomads, providing a verified hash of their global investment portfolio proves "Financial Means" to foreign consulates without needing to notarize physical bank letters.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Underwriters**
**Zero-Trust Wealth Vetting:** Thousands of "Edited" digital statements are submitted to banks every month. Live Verify connects the underwriter directly to the advisor's domain, stopping "Asset Padding" fraud at the source and protecting the bank's credit risk.

**Tax Authorities (IRS)**
**Automated Dividend Audit:** Verifying that the "Investment Income" reported on a tax return matches the verified payouts from the robo-advisor, reducing the need for manual audit flags.

**Secondary Credit Issuers (Amex / Chase)**
**Credit Limit Vetting:** Verifying the "Liquid Net Worth" of an applicant before granting a $50,000+ credit limit on a premium card.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Madoff Scenario" Fraud Problem**

- **Balance Padding:** Editing a $5,000 balance to read $50,000 on a PDF to trick a landlord or lender.
- **Performance Inflation:** Changing a 2% return into a 20% return to "sell" a strategy to friends or family (Private Placement fraud).
- **Account Mimicry:** Creating fake "Wealthfront" emails to trick people into giving up their login credentials or to steal PII.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs).**
**Broker-Dealer Platforms (Apex, Pershing).**
**Fintech Portfolio Aggregators (e.g., Plaid, Yodlee - as sub-issuers).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Investment balances and specific holdings are sensitive financial secrets. The hash must be salted to prevent "Wealth Mapping" of the population by data brokers or hackers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Nutmeg issues robo-advisor portfolio statements and is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and investment adviser rules.

```
✓ portfolio.nutmeg.com/verify — Robo-advisor platform issuing portfolio statements and statements
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK investment firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Robo-advisors are the "Modern Bank." By turning digital statements into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the stability of the consumer credit market and ensure that "Wealth" is based on the digital truth of the market, not the creative editing of a smartphone user.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the robo-advisor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (account number, net portfolio value, asset allocation, time-weighted performance, statement date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the investment statement.
