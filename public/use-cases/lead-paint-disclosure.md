## Data Verified

Property address, Seller/Lessor name, Buyer/Lessee name, specific disclosure checkboxes (Known vs Unknown), list of attached reports (if any), presence of "Protect Your Family from Lead" pamphlet, date of acknowledgment, broker/agent ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Lead Paint Disclosure Form:** (Form LP-42 equivalent).
- **Lead Inspection / Risk Assessment:** (Linked hash) if hazards are known.
- **Lead Abatement Certificate:** Proving the property was made safe.
- **Lease Addendum:** Specifically for rental transactions.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`epa.gov`, `hud.gov`, `firstam.com`) and current filing status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Disclosure matches the official closing/escrow record.
- **Incomplete** — Mandatory signatures or check-boxes are missing.
- **Void** — Replaced by a corrected disclosure (e.g., after an inspection found lead).
- **Abated** — Associated with a verified lead-free certification.

## Second-Party Use

The **Seller / Landlord** benefits from verification.

**Liability Shield:** Proving to a court or a tenant that they fulfilled their federal duty to disclose "No Knowledge" of lead. Verification ensures that a tenant can't later claim the landlord "Deleted" a page from the disclosure PDF after the lease was signed.

**Closing Speed:** Proving to a title company that the mandatory federal disclosure is verified and compliant, preventing a last-minute closing delay.

## Third-Party Use

**Tenants / Home Buyers**
**Health Assurance:** Before moving a family with small children into a pre-1978 home, the buyer scans the hash. "Verified by EPA.gov" ensures the seller isn't "Hiding" a known lead report that could cause brain damage to their children.

**Real Estate Brokers**
**Compliance Monitoring:** Ensuring that every agent in the firm is getting the mandatory disclosures signed and verified, reducing the firm's exposure to massive federal fines.

**Attorneys / Litigators**
**Chain of Disclosure:** Verifying exactly what was disclosed at the time of sale in a "Failure to Disclose" toxic tort lawsuit.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Safe Harbor" Fraud Problem**

- **Report Deletion:** A landlord receiving a positive lead test result and simply "forgetting" to attach it to the disclosure PDF.
- **Check-box Tampering:** Changing a "Presence Known" check to "No Knowledge" after the document is signed.
- **Date Forgery:** Backdating an acknowledgment to hide that the tenant didn't receive the lead pamphlet until after they moved in.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Federal Agencies:** (EPA, HUD).
**Title Companies:** (Hosting verified hashes for closings).
**Property Management Platforms:** (e.g., AppFolio, RealPage).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Regulates lead paint disclosure in residential properties.

```
✓ epa.gov/lead/disclosure/verify — Regulates lead paint disclosure in residential properties
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the property record issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (property address, disclosure date, seller/buyer names, signed status) — never lead inspection details or remediation costs — providing non-repudiation of the disclosure and an audit trail attorneys can inspect.


## Competition vs. Disclosure Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | Disclosure Portal | Scanned PDF / Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects the check-boxes. | **Data-Only.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Remains verifiable for decades. | **Low.** Portals often purge data after 3 years. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Gov/Title Co. | **System-Bound.** Trust the vendor. | **Visual.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires paying a fee or finding a login. | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Permanent Liability" problem. Lead paint liability lasts for decades. A tenant might sue in 2035 for a disclosure made in 2025. Live Verify turns the **Static Paper Disclosure** into an immutable digital anchor that survives the death of property management portals and the loss of physical filing cabinets.
