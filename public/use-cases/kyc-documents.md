## What is a KYC Identity Verification Summary?

This document represents a **vetted result**, not a raw identity credential. That distinction matters.

Where strong digital-identity infrastructure already exists, it should dominate:

- government digital identity platforms like MyInfo or SingPass
- bank-to-bank or bank-to-KYC-provider APIs
- direct issuer and registry checks

Live Verify is more defensible where a human-readable KYC summary is being forwarded between institutions or retained by the customer outside those native integrations. It should not be treated as a replacement for direct KYC APIs or government digital identity.

</div>

## Data Verified

Full name, date of birth, residential address, primary ID number (Passport/SSN), nationality, PEP (Politically Exposed Person) status, adverse media flag, sanctions list status (OFAC/EU), biometric liveness confirmation, date of onboarding.

**Document Types:**
- **KYC Passport/ID Extract:** Summary of the primary ID check.
- **Proof of Address Summary:** (Linked hash) for utility/bill verification.
- **Selfie Liveness Certificate:** Proving the user was physically present.
- **W-8BEN / W-9 Form:** (Linked hash) for tax identity.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`revolut.com`, `chase.com`, `coinbase.com`) and current compliance standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Identity is current and background checks are clear.
- **Restricted** — **ALERT:** Identity verified but account limited due to risk.
- **Suspended** — Potential fraud or expired ID; re-verification required.
- **Blacklisted** — Associated with known criminal activity.

## Second-Party Use

The **Bank Customer** (second party) receives the KYC verification summary from the bank (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of their identity verification status. Most of the time, the record sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that their identity verification matches what the bank's system recorded and their status remains in good standing.

**Future Optionality:** If they need to open accounts elsewhere or prove their identity—whether for financial services, rentals, or visa applications—they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the original bank.

## Third-Party Use

The customer (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Mortgage Lenders / Neobanks**
**Reciprocal KYC:** This is only defensible where a direct API or government digital-ID path is not available. If stronger native integration exists, that should remain primary.

**FinCEN / Regulators**
**Compliance Audit:** During a bank examination, federal auditors can scan random customer files. "Verified by Revolut" ensures the bank isn't "Ghosting" their KYC duties by maintaining fake or un-vetted accounts.

**Crypto Exchanges**
**Fiat Gateway:** Verifying the source identity of a user before allowing large-scale crypto-to-fiat transfers.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Synthetic Identity" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Fabrication:** Using a mix of real and fake data to create a "Synthetic Person" who doesn't exist. Verification against the bank domain prevents this.
- **Photo Substitution:** Using a stolen ID number but editing the photo on the PDF to match the fraudster.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A user whose account was closed for money laundering yesterday using their old "Verified" paper summary to open a new account today.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Retail Banks
- Digital Wallets / Neobanks
- KYC Service Providers (e.g., Onfido, Jumio, Persona - hosting the hashes)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. KYC documents contain highly sensitive personal information with enumerable values—common names, standard date of birth formats, publicly listed addresses, passport number patterns, and predictable status categories (verified, restricted, suspended). A malicious actor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer customer identities, map bank populations, or target specific demographics. Salt is absolutely critical to protect this ultimate target for identity theft and financial fraud.

## Jurisdictional Equivalents

| | UK | US | EU |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Authority** | FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) | FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) | Member state competent authorities under 4MLD/5MLD |
| **Document** | KYC identity verification record | CDD (Customer Due Diligence) record | KYC verification record |
| **Legal basis** | MLR 2017 (Money Laundering Regulations); electronic verification via credit reference agencies | FinCEN CDD Rule (2018); BSA/AML requirements; state-level requirements vary | 4MLD/5MLD (4th/5th Anti-Money Laundering Directives); each member state implements nationally |
| **Potential verify: domain** | `fca.org.uk/register` | `fincen.gov/bsa` | Varies by member state |
| **Key difference** | Electronic verification standard via credit reference agencies (Experian, Equifax); simplified due diligence for low-risk | Federal CDD Rule sets baseline; states may impose additional requirements; no national digital ID system | Each member state transposes the directive differently; eIDAS provides emerging cross-border digital identity framework |

**Further Jurisdictional Peers**

- **Australia:** AUSTRAC AML/CTF Act 2006; 100-point identification system for customer verification. Australia pioneered points-based ID verification.
- **Canada:** FINTRAC — PCMLTFA (Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act) KYC requirements. Digital ID verification is emerging across provinces.
- **Singapore:** MAS CDD requirements under Notice 626/824; MyInfo integration enables digital KYC using government-verified identity data.
- **Japan:** JAFIC — verification of identity under the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds. Japan requires in-person or equivalent verification for higher-risk relationships.
- **Switzerland:** FINMA — CDB 20 (Agreement on Due Diligence); strict bank secrecy tradition combined with rigorous KYC obligations for all financial intermediaries.
- **Hong Kong:** HKMA/SFC — CDD requirements under AMLO (Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance). Risk-based approach aligned with FATF standards.

**Bribery & Corruption**

KYC processes must identify PEPs, check against corruption databases, and flag proceeds of corruption — the onboarding stage is the primary control point for preventing corrupt individuals from accessing financial services.

- **Wolfsberg Group:** Anti-Corruption Guidance (2017) — sets global banking standards for corruption-related due diligence at onboarding; requires banks to assess bribery/corruption risk as part of KYC, not just AML risk
- **US:** FCPA enforcement increasingly focuses on bank KYC failures that facilitated bribery payments — banks face liability for onboarding clients whose funds derive from foreign corruption
- **UK:** FCA has fined banks for weak PEP controls within KYC processes (e.g., Deutsche Bank £163m fine in 2017 for mirror trading/AML failures; Standard Chartered £102m for AML/sanctions breaches)
- **Singapore:** MAS took enforcement action against multiple banks for KYC failures related to the 1MDB corruption case — demonstrating that KYC is a frontline anti-corruption control, not just an AML formality

**Fraud Prevention**

KYC failures are the primary enabler of identity fraud — distinct from money laundering. Synthetic identities (combining real and fabricated data) cost US banks an estimated ~$6B/year. KYC verification is the frontline control that prevents onboarding of fraudulent identities before they can be used for credit fraud, account takeover, or benefit theft.

- **UK:** CIFAS markers interact directly with KYC — banks check the CIFAS National Fraud Database before account opening. An identity flagged with a fraud marker triggers enhanced due diligence or refusal. This is a fraud check, not an AML check, and operates under separate data-sharing agreements.
- **US:** FinCEN Beneficial Ownership and CDD requirements address identity verification, but fraud-specific protections come from different frameworks: FTC's IdentityTheft.gov for victim reporting, the Red Flags Rule (FACTA s.114) requiring financial institutions to detect identity theft warning signs during onboarding. No single fraud marker database — fragmented across ChexSystems, Early Warning Services, and credit bureau fraud alerts.
- **Australia:** The 100-point ID verification system was designed primarily as an anti-fraud measure, not an AML measure. The Document Verification Service (DVS) provides real-time government document checks — verifying that a passport or driver licence number matches the issuing agency's records, directly preventing document forgery in KYC.
- **Singapore:** MyInfo (government digital identity platform) eliminates document fraud risk in KYC entirely — verified identity attributes are pulled directly from government databases via SingPass integration, removing the need for customers to present physical documents that could be forged.
- **India:** Aadhaar-based eKYC uses biometric verification (fingerprint/iris) to eliminate document forgery — relevant as an emerging global model for fraud-resistant KYC. Over 1.3 billion enrolments make it the world's largest biometric identity system. The model is being studied by other jurisdictions seeking to move beyond document-based KYC.

**Cybercrime-Enabled Financial Crime**

AI-generated deepfake documents and synthetic identities are emerging as the next generation of KYC fraud; liveness detection and biometric verification are the countermeasures.

- **Deepfake documents:** AI can now generate convincing passport images, utility bills, and bank statements; KYC providers (Onfido, Jumio) are in an arms race with generative AI
- **UK:** FCA has flagged deepfake-enabled KYC fraud as an emerging risk; no specific legislation yet but Fraud Act 2006 covers the conduct
- **Singapore:** MAS has issued guidance on technology risks in digital onboarding including deepfake detection requirements
- **Biometric countermeasures:** India's Aadhaar, Singapore's SingPass, EU's eIDAS 2.0 — government-issued digital identities provide stronger assurance than document-based KYC against cyber fraud

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the bank or KYC provider's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (verification dates, document types, PEP status, sanctions check results) — never plaintext such as customer names or passport numbers — providing non-repudiation of performing KYC verification.

## Competition vs. ID Verification APIs (Onfido)

| Feature | Live Verify | KYC API (Jumio/Onfido) | Scanned PDF ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** User shares only the *Vetted Profile*. | **Low.** Requires uploading raw ID photos to the cloud. | **High.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Bank. | **System-Bound.** Trust the vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Works across all banks. | **Low.** Every bank uses a different API vendor. | **Universal.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires 30-120 seconds for AI processing. | **N/A.** |

**Practical conclusion:** when government digital identity or direct KYC APIs are available, they should dominate. Live Verify is most credible as a portability layer for a vetted summary traveling outside those integrations, not as the primary architecture for identity verification itself.

utility company's official billing records.

</pre>
<span data-verify-line="address">verify:coned.com/billing/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="address"></span>
</div>

## Data Verified

Customer name, full service address, billing period dates, total amount due (numerical), account status (Active/Closed), issuing utility/bank name, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Utility Bill:** (Electric, Water, Gas).
- **Telecom Bill:** (Mobile, Internet).
- **Bank / Credit Card Statement:** (Linked hash) for address proof.
- **Council Tax / Property Tax Bill:** (High trust).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`coned.com`, `verizon.com`, `chase.com`) and current account standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Address and name match the official billing file.
- **Closed** — Account is terminated; address may be outdated.
- **Disconnected** — **ALERT:** Service stopped; residency may be fraudulent.
- **Amended** — A correction was issued for this billing period.

## Second-Party Use

The **Bank Customer / Tenant** benefits from verification.

**Digital Onboarding:** Proving their current residence to a Neobank (e.g., Revolut or Chime) without having to "Wait for a paper letter in the mail." A verified hash from the utility domain removes the #1 cause of KYC rejection: **Unreadable or Outdated Utility Bills.**

**Visa / Residency:** Proving local residency to a foreign embassy or consulate using a verified, cryptographically trusted document.

## Third-Party Use

**Neobanks / Crypto Exchanges**
**Instant Address Match:** Automatically verifying the "Address String" provided in the signup form against the verified utility hash. Live Verify allows for **Zero-Human-Review** onboarding of customers, even those with thin credit files.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Residency Audit:** Verifying that a borrower is actually living in their primary residence (and not using it as an undisclosed rental) by checking the verified utility status.

**Government Agencies (DMV)**
**Proof of Residency:** Verifying address claims for Real ID issuance without requiring physical paper folders.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Photoshopped Bill" Fraud Problem**

- **Address Forgery:** Scammers taking a real Con-Ed bill and editing the "Apt 4B" to match a more desirable or expensive address to commit bank fraud.
- **Identity Swapping:** Editing the name on a valid bill to match a stolen identity.
- **Date Alteration:** Editing a 2022 bill to read "March 2026" to hide that the person moved away 4 years ago.

**Issuer Types**

**Utility Companies.**
**Telecom Providers.**
**Municipal Tax Authorities.**
**Retail Banks.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Addresses are PII. The hash must be salted to prevent "Mass Mapping" of a city's residents by scanning the utility domain.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Barclays Bank, a regulated financial institution, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified KYC identity verification and customer onboarding documents.

```
✓ kyc.barclays.co.uk/verify — Issues verified KYC identity verification documents
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK financial crime prevention
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition vs. Address Verification APIs (Experian)

| Feature | Live Verify | Address API (Experian/Loqate) | Scanned PDF / Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Name* to the *Address*. | **Vague.** Only proves the address *exists*. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Utility. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Visual.** |
| **Privacy** | **High.** User shares only the *Bill Summary*. | **Low.** Lenders see full credit history. | **High.** |
| **Coverage** | **Universal.** Works for any small utility with a URL. | **Limited.** Only for people with credit records. | **Universal.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Thin File" problem. Millions of people (young people, expats, immigrants) don't have enough credit history for Experian to verify their address. But they **all** have a utility or mobile bill. Live Verify allows them to use their **Service Reality** as a verified trust signal, bypassing the need for a legacy credit score.
