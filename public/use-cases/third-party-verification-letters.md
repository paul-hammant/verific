## What are Third-Party Verification Letters?

In high-stakes financial decisions (Mortgages, Auto Loans, Rental Screening), lenders don't trust the applicant's word. They use a **Third-Party Verifier** (e.g., The Work Number, Equifax, or a CPA) to independently confirm the applicant's income and employment status.

These letters are the "Seal of Solvency." Fraud is rampant: people create fake "CPAs" with fake websites to "verify" their own income, or they "edit" a real verification report to hide a job termination or to double their salary. Verified hashes bind the **Subject's Name, Verified Income, and Verifier's Authority** to the verifier's domain (e.g., `equifax.com` or `experian.com`).

## Data Verified

Subject name, SSN (masked), employer name, job title, employment status (Active/Inactive), date of hire, base salary, bonus/commission data, total year-to-date earnings, verifier ID, date of report.

**Document Types:**
- **Employment Verification Report:** (VOE) Standard for lending.
- **Income Verification (VOI):** Detailed 3-year history.
- **Background Check Summary:** (Linked hash) criminal/credit check.
- **CPA Certification Letter:** For self-employed individuals.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`equifax.com`, `workday.com`, `experian.com`) and the verification standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Accurate** — Data matches the verifier's live payroll link.
- **Employment Ended** — **ALERT:** The subject is no longer employed at the company.
- **Data Mismatch** — **ALERT:** The salary on the paper does not match the payroll system.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** Verifier has withdrawn the report (e.g., due to discovered applicant fraud).

## Second-Party Use

The **Applicant (Borrower / Tenant)** benefits from verification.

**Mortgage Approval Speed:** When applying for a loan, the borrower provides the verified hash of their "Work Number" report. The lender can instantly see **"VERIFIED SALARY: $145,000"** from a trusted third party, removing the 3-day "Manual Audit" delay and potentially securing a lower rate.

**Rental Applications:** A prospective tenant can show a verified income hash to a landlord. "Verified by Equifax" ensures the landlord that the applicant has the financial means to pay the rent, removing the need for 3 months of invasive bank statements.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Underwriters / Banks**
**Zero-Trust Vetting:** Thousands of fake "CPA Letters" are submitted to banks every month. Live Verify connects the underwriter directly to the verifier's domain, stopping "Income Padding" fraud and protecting the bank's loan portfolio.

**Property Managers**
**Applicant Filtering:** Instantly filtering for only verified, employment-stable candidates, reducing the risk of "Non-Payment" evictions.

**HR & Recruiting Firms**
**Candidate Vetting:** Verifying that a candidate's "Previous Title and Salary" are accurate facts before making a high-value job offer.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Verifier" Fraud Problem**

- **Verifier Spoofing:** Creating a fake company website (e.g., `verified-income-cpa.com`) to vouch for a fraudulent loan application.
- **Amount Inflation:** Changing a $45,000 verified salary to $145,000 on a PDF report.
- **Job Status Hiding:** Presenting a "Verified Report" from 6 months ago as if it were "Today's" status for a person who was recently fired.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Employment Data Hubs.**
**Payroll Platform Providers (Workday, ADP).**
**Licensed CPAs / Accounting Firms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Individual income data is protected by strict privacy laws (FCRA). The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Income Scraping" of the workforce.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues employment verification letters

```
✓ hr.example-corp.com/voe/verify — Issues employment verification letters
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Third-party verification is the "Check and Balance" of the financial system. By turning these reports into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that high-stakes credit decisions are based on the digital truth of payroll, not the creative editing of an applicant.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive verifiers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (subject name, SSN masked, employer name, job title, employment status, date of hire, base salary, bonus/commission data, total year-to-date earnings, verifier ID, date of report) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the verification letter.
