## What is an Inspector Badge?

A **Building Inspector Badge** is the identification carried by city officials who enter private homes and businesses to check for safety (Electrical, Plumbing, Fire).

Because these officials have the legal right to walk into your kitchen or basement, criminals often pose as "Inspectors" to gain entry for burglary or to extort fake fines.

Live Verify allows a homeowner to scan the badge at the door and see a green "ACTIVE" status from the city's own domain, proving the person is a real employee and not a scammer.

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the homeowner's or occupier's perspective. The inspection visit is initiated by the municipal authority.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The inspector can cite code violations, impose fines, condemn work, or require costly remediation — consequences that are difficult and expensive to challenge after the fact.

**Verification asymmetry:** The occupier is being asked to grant entry immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the person at the door is a current, authorized inspector for the claimed department.

## Data Verified

Inspector name, photo (hash), badge number, department/division (Electrical, Plumbing, Fire), authority statute, employment status (Active/Retired/Suspended), jurisdiction.

**Document Types:**
- **Inspector ID Card (Badge):** Carried by the official.
- **Entry Authorization Letter:** For large-scale site audits.
- **Notice of Inspection:** Left at the door if owner is away.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Badge is valid, bearer is authorized to inspect
- **SUSPENDED** — Employee is on leave or under disciplinary review; not authorized
- **ALERT** — Badge reported lost/stolen; do not admit, consider calling police
- **404** — Badge not found (retired, terminated, or never issued)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `cityofchicago.org`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, the endpoint can return optional actions for the homeowner:

```
HTTP 200 OK

Status: OK

--- Optional Follow-Up ---

Are you a homeowner? You may report details of this inspection visit.
You will NEVER be told not to do this or that it is not needed.

POST to: https://cityofchicago.org/inspect/report/992288

Fields:
- Your address
- Date/time of visit
- Inspection type claimed by inspector
- Was identification shown before entry?
- Any concerns or issues?
- Request callback from department? [Y/N]
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Audit trail:** City knows their inspector was verified at this address at this time—even if no formal inspection report is filed
- **Pattern detection:** Inspector verified at 50 addresses but only 10 inspection reports filed? Investigation triggered
- **Citizen empowerment:** Homeowner has agency; reporting is always welcomed, never discouraged
- **Complaint channel:** "Inspector demanded cash" or "Inspector was rude" goes directly to HR with verified badge number attached
- **Bribery deterrent:** Inspectors know homeowners can easily report; reduces corruption opportunity

**The "Never Discouraged" Principle:**

The message explicitly states reporting is *always* appropriate. This prevents:
- Inspectors intimidating homeowners ("don't bother reporting, it's routine")
- Homeowners feeling they're wasting the city's time
- Gatekeeping by department staff who might dismiss reports

Every report is logged. The city can triage later—but the citizen is never told their input isn't wanted.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner** (Homeowner or Business) benefits from verification.

**Anti-Scam Protection:** Criminals often pose as "Gas Inspectors" or "Building Officials" to gain entry to a home to case it for burglary or to extort "On-the-spot fines" from elderly residents. Scanning the badge instantly proves the person at the door is a legitimate city official.

**Corporate Security:** Large industrial sites can integrate the inspector's verified hash into their visitor management logs, creating a digital record of exactly who from the city accessed the facility.

## Third-Party Use

**Police Departments**
**Impersonation Calls:** When a suspicious homeowner calls 911 about a "Fake Inspector," the dispatcher can ask the homeowner to scan the badge. If it verifies against the city domain, the police response can be downgraded from "Trespassing" to "Routine."

**City Human Resources**
**Liability Control:** Ensuring that only active, background-checked employees are using their badges to enter private properties.

**Utility Companies**
**Joint Inspections:** Verifying the credentials of municipal partners during joint safety sweeps.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Official" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Scammers buying realistic-looking "Inspector" uniforms and fake IDs online.
- **Credential Hiding:** A terminated inspector keeping their physical badge and continuing to "inspect" businesses to demand bribes.
- **Scope Misrepresentation:** An electrical inspector pretending they have the authority to shut down a restaurant for "Health Violations."

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Municipal Governments:** (Building Dept, Fire Dept, Health Dept).
**State Agencies:** (OSHA, Environmental Protection).
**Federal Agencies:** (FBI, EPA, DEA).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Local authorities employ building inspectors authorized by the Building Act 1984 and Building Regulations 2010.

```
✓ inspector.localauthority.gov.uk/verify — Local authority building safety inspector badges
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the municipal authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the badge.


## Competition vs. ID Badges / Phone Calls

| Feature | Live Verify | Holographic Badge | Calling the Office |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `cityofchicago.org`. | **Mechanical.** Hard to forge, but non-verifiable. | **Human.** Relies on someone answering the phone. |
| **Photo Verification** | **Confirms authenticity.** Badge photo is real; homeowner compares face. | **Static.** Photo is on the badge, but is the badge real? | **None.** Voice only. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **N/A.** Just looking. | **Slow.** Often takes 5-10 minutes on hold. |
| **Revocation** | **Real-time.** Suspended/stolen badges fail immediately. | **None.** Physical badge still looks valid. | **Maybe.** If office knows and tells you. |

**Why this remains strong:** The doorstep workflow is the real issue. Homeowners are often intimidated by officials and may not want a long conversation or phone call while someone waits outside. City systems remain primary in the background, but the badge is the visible surface at the decision point. That makes this a strong complementary case for non-confrontational verification before entry.
