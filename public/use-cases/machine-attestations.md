## What is a Machine Attestation?

Machines generate data continuously—temperatures, locations, energy readings, operational metrics. A **Machine Attestation** is a snapshot of that data, signed by the device or its managing system, made human-readable and verifiable through OCR.

The machine doesn't lie. The question is whether the reading was tampered with between generation and verification.

## Why Machine Attestations Matter

**Continuous vs. Point-in-Time**
Machines record continuously. Attestations capture specific moments or periods, making them auditable.

**Tamper Evidence**
Sensor data flows through systems. Each attestation hash includes the chain of custody from sensor to document.

**Human-Readable Summaries**
Raw telemetry is incomprehensible. Attestations summarize: "Temperature stayed within range" rather than 847 individual readings.

## Data Verified

Sensor/device ID, reading timestamp, measurement values, units, acceptable ranges, excursion flags, chain of custody identifiers.

**Document Types:**
- **Cold Chain Certificate:** Temperature-sensitive shipments (vaccines, food, biologics)
- **Energy Meter Reading:** Solar export, consumption, net metering
- **Odometer Attestation:** Vehicle mileage at inspection points
- **Environmental Reading:** Air quality, water quality, noise levels
- **Fleet Telemetry:** Vehicle location, speed, driver assignment
- **Charging Session:** EV energy delivery and carbon calculations
- **Industrial Sensor:** Manufacturing tolerances, pressure, vibration

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (sensor network operator) and reading timestamp.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Attestation matches recorded sensor data
- **Excursion** — Readings went outside acceptable range (attestation still valid, but flags issue)
- **Gap** — Missing sensor data during attested period
- **Calibration Due** — Sensor requires recalibration (readings may be less accurate)

## Second-Party Use

The **Operator** (fleet owner, shipper, property owner) benefits from verification.

**Compliance Proof:** "Our cold chain never broke" is verifiable, not just claimed.

**Dispute Resolution:** When cargo arrives damaged, verified temperature logs establish liability.

**Incentive Claims:** Solar feed-in tariffs, carbon credits, and efficiency rebates require verified readings.

## Third-Party Use

**Insurers**
**Claims Processing:** Verified sensor data establishes what happened (temperature excursion, vehicle location at time of incident).

**Regulators**
**Compliance Monitoring:** FDA, EPA, OSHA can verify continuous compliance from attestations.

**Buyers**
**Product Integrity:** Verify that goods were properly handled throughout supply chain.

**Finance**
**Asset Valuation:** Verified mileage affects vehicle residual value. Verified energy production supports solar asset financing.

## Verification Architecture

**Sensor Trust Chain**

```
Physical Sensor → Gateway/Collector → Cloud Platform → Attestation Generator → Verifiable Document
```

Each step can be audited. The hash commits to the entire chain.

**Calibration Tracking**

Sensors drift. Attestations can include calibration status:
- Last calibration date
- Calibration certificate reference
- Whether reading is within calibration validity

**Aggregation Rules**

Raw data (847 temperature readings) is summarized (min/max/mean, excursion count). Attestations specify aggregation method so verifiers understand what they're confirming.

**Multi-Sensor Correlation**

Some attestations combine multiple sensors:
- GPS + accelerometer = verified delivery (arrived at location, no drops)
- Temperature + humidity + door sensor = cold chain integrity

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

IoT device manufacturers and sensor networks issue attestations summarizing continuous machine-generated data. The issuer is self-authorized as the device operator responsible for data integrity.

```
✓ iot.example-manufacturer.com/attest/verify — Attests machine readings (temperature, location, performance) with calibration status
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Novel Applications

**Predictive Maintenance Proof**
"This equipment has been serviced per manufacturer schedule" with sensor-verified operating hours.

**Carbon Accounting**
Verified energy readings feed into carbon calculations. The attestation proves the input data.

**Usage-Based Insurance**
Pay-per-mile insurance requires verified odometer readings. Telematics attestations enable fair pricing.

**Supply Chain Transparency**
Each handler adds their attestation. Final recipient sees complete verified journey.

**Live Environmental Status Displays (defeating the "pencil-whipped" sheet)**
Static "Last Cleaned / Last Inspected" sheets on a wall are trivially falsified — signed off without the work being done (the "pencil-whipped" problem). A machine attestation bound to a *live* sensor feed replaces the plaque with a verifiable, current claim: an e-ink display in a hospital ward, hotel gym, food-prep area, or office lobby shows a hash bound to real readings — HEPA-filter pressure, CO2 level, water temperature, or recent autonomous cleaning-bot cycles. An occupant scans it and gets metrology-grade trust that the environment meets standard **right now**, not a static sheet from three months ago. Because the attestation is the sensor's own (machine-signed), and because it is a [point-in-time reading](../../docs/point-in-time-vs-current.md), it should carry an as-at timestamp and a short validity window — a captured photo of the display is a reading of a past moment, not the present state.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the sensor network operator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the attestation and an audit trail jurisdictions can inspect.
