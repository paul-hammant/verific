## What is a Carbon Credit Retirement?

When a company (like Microsoft or Apple) claims to be "Net Zero," they often buy **Carbon Credits**—digital certificates representing one tonne of CO2 removed from the atmosphere (e.g., by planting trees).

The most important step is **Retirement**. Once a credit is "retired," it is taken off the market so it can't be sold again. It is "used up" to balance the company's pollution.

The **Retirement Certificate** is the only proof that the company actually did what it said. Without verification, a company could lie about retiring credits, leading to "Greenwashing" where the same tree is "sold" to 10 different companies.

## Data Verified

Credit holder (beneficiary), project name/ID, vintage year, quantity (tonnes CO2e), serial number range, date of retirement, certification standard (VCS, Gold Standard), verification body (e.g., SCS Global).

**Document Types:**
- **Retirement Certificate:** Proving the credit was "used" to offset a specific footprint.
- **Issuance Certificate:** For project developers (pre-retirement).
- **Audit Statement:** 3rd party verification of project performance.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`verra.org`, `goldstandard.org`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Retired** — Credits permanently out of circulation; offset valid.
- **Active** — Credits available for trade; offset not yet "claimed."
- **Cancelled** — Credits voided (e.g., due to project reversal like a fire).
- **Buffer Pool** — Held in reserve for risk management.

## Second-Party Use

The **Credit Buyer** (second party) receives the retirement certificate from the carbon registry (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the retired credits. Most of the time, the document sits in their sustainability files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the retirement matches what the registry's system recorded and hasn't been altered or double-counted.

**Future Optionality:** If questions arise—whether from SEC reporting requirements, shareholder scrutiny, or regulatory audits—they have cryptographic proof of the retirement ready without needing to contact the registry.

## Third-Party Use

The credit buyer (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**ESG Rating Agencies (MSCI / Sustainalytics)**
**Data Integrity:** Rating agencies verify corporate environmental claims. Live Verify allows them to instantly ingest verified retirement data from PDF reports without manual registry searches.

**Environmental Regulators**
**Cap-and-Trade Compliance:** Ensuring that industrial emitters are using valid, non-cancelled credits to meet their regulatory obligations.

**Climate Activists / NGOs**
**Greenwashing Detection:** Enabling civil society to verify the "Registry Status" of credits claimed in marketing campaigns, catching companies that use "Zombie Credits" (already retired or cancelled).

## Verification Architecture

**The "Double-Counting" Fraud Problem**

- **Double-Retirement:** Selling the same carbon offset to two different companies. Verification reveals that the credits are already "Retired" to another beneficiary.
- **Ghost Credits:** Creating fake certificates for projects that were never registered or never actually reduced emissions.
- **Vintage Tampering:** Editing a 2015 vintage (low value) to look like a 2025 vintage (high value).

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Carbon Registries (Verra, Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry)
- National Registries (Under Paris Agreement Article 6)
- Verification Bodies (3rd party auditors who sign the reports)

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Carbon retirement certificates contain many unpredictable variables: unique certificate IDs, beneficiary company names, specific project names and IDs, exact quantities (often large, precise numbers in tonnes), vintage years, retirement dates, and serial number ranges. The combination of these project-specific details creates sufficient entropy to prevent hash enumeration attacks.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Carbon credit registries are regulated by environmental protection agencies to ensure only verified, legitimate credits are retired and cannot be double-counted across jurisdictions.

```
✓ credits.goldstandard.org/verify — Issues verified carbon credit retirement certificates
  ✓ environment-agency.gov.uk — Regulates environmental protection in England
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the registry's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (certificate ID, quantity in tonnes CO2e, vintage year, project name, retirement date, retiring entity) — never project-level financial or proprietary verification details — providing non-repudiation of credit retirement and an audit trail for environmental agencies and corporate ESG compliance.

## Competition vs. Blockchain (Climate Ledger)

| Feature | Live Verify | Tokenized Carbon (On-Chain) | Public Registry PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Control** | **High.** Share only the *Retirement* proof. | **Low.** Wallet history is often public. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Registry (Verra). | **Byzantine.** Trust the consensus/protocol. | **Visual.** |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works with existing PDF reports. | **Siloed.** Different chains (Polygon, Toucan) don't talk. | **Manual.** |
| **Persistence** | **Archival.** Text lasts decades. | **Fragile.** Requires the chain to exist in 2050. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Legacy Integration. Most corporate carbon accounting is still done via PDF reports and Excel. Blockchain requires a massive tech shift. Live Verify provides **Blockchain-level integrity** for the existing world of PDF certificates, bridging the gap to the future of climate finance without the "Crypto-Stigma."
