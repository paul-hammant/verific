## What is a Porting Authorization?

When you switch your phone number from one carrier to another (e.g., AT&T to T-Mobile), you must sign a **Letter of Agency (LOA)**. This document is the legal "Key" to your digital identity. In the era of 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication), your phone number is often the only thing standing between a hacker and your bank account.

**SIM Swapping** is a major global crime where hackers forge these authorizations to steal a victim's phone number. Once they control the number, they reset passwords and drain accounts. Verified hashes bind the **Account Number, Zip Code, and Intent to Port** to the losing carrier's domain (e.g., `att.com` or `verizon.com`), ensuring that a "Porting Request" is a verified action from the real owner.

## Data Verified

Authorized signer name, telephone number(s) to be ported, losing carrier name, winning carrier name, account number (masked), service address zip code, date of authorization, porting PIN status, internal fraud-score hash.

**Document Types:**
- **Letter of Agency (LOA):** The primary customer authorization.
- **Porting Request Summary:** The digital data sent between carriers.
- **CSR (Customer Service Record):** (Linked hash) proving account ownership.
- **Identity Verification Receipt:** Proof the customer passed a biometric check.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`att.com`, `t-mobile.com`, `verizon.com`) and the porting standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized / Pending** — The porting request is valid and awaiting execution.
- **Port Completed** — **ALERT:** The number has already been moved; this paper is historic.
- **Fraud Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The account holder has flagged this number for "No Porting."
- **Invalid PIN** — **ALERT:** The porting PIN on the paper does not match the system.

## Second-Party Use

The **Account Holder (Consumer)** benefits from verification.

**SIM Swap Defense:** An owner can place a "Verified Lock" on their number. If a hacker tries to port the number using a fake PDF, the winning carrier's automated system scans the hash. If it returns **"FRAUD ALERT"** or **"NOT AUTHORIZED,"** the port is blocked instantly, protecting the owner's bank and email accounts.

**Carrier Switching:** When arriving at a new store (e.g., T-Mobile) to switch service, the customer provides the verified hash from their old carrier (e.g., AT&T). The clerk can instantly see **"VERIFIED INTENT"** on their screen, removing the need for 30-minute "manual verification" phone calls between carriers.

## Third-Party Use

**Winning Carriers (The Receiving Provider)**
**Compliance Vetting:** FCC rules require the winning carrier to obtain a valid LOA. Live Verify allows them to bulk-verify that thousands of incoming porting requests are authentic and haven't been "Faked" by aggressive sales agents trying to meet quotas.

**Banks and Financial Institutions**
**Identity Vetting:** Before sending a high-value wire, a bank can scan the verified hash of the customer's "Porting History." If the number was ported in the last 24 hours (a major SIM-Swap red flag), the bank can block the wire and require in-person ID.

**Law Enforcement**
**Crime Investigation:** Verifying the "Chain of Authorization" for a phone number used in a fraudulent transaction to determine if the number was stolen via a fake LOA.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Port" Fraud Problem**

- **PIN Theft:** Hackers social-engineering a customer's porting PIN and then creating a fake LOA to match it.
- **Account Number Padding:** Editing a PDF to add 10 "Ghost Numbers" to a legitimate single-number porting request.
- **Identity Mimicry:** Creating a fake LOA for a victim's number using PII stolen from a data breach.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Mobile Carriers.**
**VoIP Service Providers (Twilio, Bandwidth).**
**Centralized Porting Databases (e.g., NPAC).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Telephone numbers and account data are the keys to a person's life. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Phone Mapping" by hackers or marketers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Porting authorizations are issued by mobile carriers and regulated by the UK communications authority.

```
✓ porting.bt.com/verify — Issues porting letters of agency and authorization confirmations
  ✓ ofcom.org.uk — Regulates UK communications services
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Number porting is the "Identity Pivot" of the modern world. By turning authorizations into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the consumer's digital life from the multi-billion dollar cost of SIM-Swap fraud and ensure that "Permission to Move" is a cryptographic fact.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (telephone numbers being ported, account numbers masked, service zip codes, porting dates, authorization statuses) — never sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the porting authorization.
