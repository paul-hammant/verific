## Data Verified

Insured name, property address, Cadastral/Parcel reference ID, country of jurisdiction, Amount of Insurance (USD/local), policy number, effective date, issuing underwriter, specific risk endorsements (e.g., "Forced Removal Affirmative Cover").

**Document Types:**
- **Title Insurance Policy:** The primary legal indemnity.
- **Commitment / Binder:** Temporary proof during the escrow period.
- **Search Report (Title Report):** Verified history of prior ownership.
- **Zoning Endorsement:** Proving legal land-use rights in a foreign city.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`firstam.com`, `stewart.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; title is verified and insured.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated (often due to misrepresentation of ownership).
- **Claim Active** — Dispute reported (e.g., a "Surprise Heir" appeared in France).
- **Closed** — Liability discharged (rare for title insurance).

## Second-Party Use

The **Real Estate Investor (Insured)** benefits from verification.

**Unlocking Finance:** Proving to a global lender (e.g., HSBC or Citi) that their $25M French hotel investment has a "Verified US-Backed Title Policy." Banks are often terrified of "Local Registry" risks in foreign countries; a verified hash from a major US underwriter removes this fear and triggers the loan release.

**Exit Strategy:** When selling the property 5 years later, the owner can provide a verified "Chain of Title" hash to the buyer, proving the property has been continuously insured by a reputable carrier.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders (Cross-Border)**
**Risk Mitigation:** Instantly verifying that the "Title Policy" in the closing package isn't a fake PDF created by a shell company. Live Verify connects the bank's compliance team directly to the underwriter's domain, stopping "Phantom Collateral" fraud.

**Foreign Notaries / Lawyers**
**Legalization:** Confirming the authenticity of an international insurance policy before performing a local land-registry transfer.

**Internal Revenue Service (IRS)**
**Asset Audit:** Verifying the "Cost Basis" and "Ownership Integrity" of foreign real estate holdings during high-value audits (FATCA/FBAR context).

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Land" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Policies:** Fraudsters using fake letterhead from "First American" to sell nonexistent title insurance to expat buyers in developing nations.
- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $1M "Small Condo" policy to read $10M to secure a massive bridge loan from an unsuspecting lender.
- **Exclusion Removal:** Deleting the page that lists "Known Encroachments" or "Restrictive Covenants" to make a lot look more developable than it is.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Title Carriers:** (First American, Stewart Title, Old Republic, Fidelity National).
**International Law Firms:** (Hosting verified hashes for settlement escrows).
**National Land Registries:** (In advanced jurisdictions like the UK or Singapore).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

International title underwriters must be licensed by state insurance regulators to issue title insurance policies.

```
✓ title.stewartintl.com/verify — Issues international title insurance policies
  ✓ insurance.ca.gov — Regulates insurance companies in California
    ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the title underwriter's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, property address, coverage limits, policy year) — never coverage exclusions or title defect details — providing non-repudiation of the insurance policy and an audit trail international lenders can inspect.


## Competition vs. Local Land Registries

| Feature | Live Verify | Local Land Registry (e.g., France) | Scanned PDF Policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Underwriter. | **Gov-Bound.** (In local language). | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Verified PDF works for a US Bank. | **Low.** US banks can't easily parse French registries. | **Universal.** |
| **Financial Backing** | **Direct.** Proves the $25M promise. | **None.** A registry only proves *who* owns it. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Very Slow.** Often takes weeks for a "Title Search." | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Translation of Trust." A US bank doesn't trust a paper from a small town in rural Italy. But they **do trust** `firstam.com`. Live Verify turns the **Local Property Data** into a verified, US-backed financial artifact that can be instantly audited by anyone, anywhere in the world.
