## What is a Driver License?

A **Driver License** is the world's most common ID. It proves you are allowed to operate a motor vehicle, but it's also your "Primary Identity" for buying alcohol, renting a car, or boarding a plane.

The problem? "High-Quality Fakes" are now so good that even expert bouncers and police can be fooled.

But driver's licenses already have a native machine-readable layer: barcode/PDF417 on the card, and increasingly direct DMV or mobile-ID channels. That means Live Verify is at best a **complementary** path when the verifier only has a photo, scan, or visual presentation and lacks barcode or DMV tooling. It is not the natural dominant architecture for driver's licenses.

## Data Verified

Full name, date of birth, physical descriptors (Height/Eye Color), license number, license class (A/B/C), endorsements (Motorcycle/Hazmat), expiration date, REAL ID compliance status, organ donor status, issuing jurisdiction.

**What the card shows vs. what the record shows:**

| License Card | Driving Record |
|--------------|----------------|
| Identity (photo, name, DOB) | Points and endorsements |
| Categories held | Violation history |
| Expiry date | Disqualification history |
| Revoked/suspended status | Endorsement codes and dates |

The card proves identity and basic validity. For points/violations, see [Authority-Issued Driving Records](view.html?doc=driving-records).

**Document Types:**
- **Driver's License:** The foundational ID card.
- **Interim License:** 30-day paper proof for new drivers.
- **Learner's Permit / Provisional License:** Restricted driving privileges for new drivers.

For vehicle registration verification, see [Vehicle Registration](view.html?doc=vehicle-registration).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dmv.ca.gov`, `nysdmv.com`) and current license status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — License is active and in good standing.
- **Suspended** — Driving privileges removed (e.g., DUI or points).
- **Expired** — Renewal required.
- **Stolen** — License reported missing (fraud detection).

## Second-Party Use

The **Named Individual** benefits from verification.

**Age-Restricted Purchases:** Proving to a bartender or cannabis retailer that the "May 15, 1985" birthdate isn't a "Fake ID" modification. Verification against the DMV domain removes the retailer's fear of "Secret Shopper" fines.

**Car Rental:** Proving to a rental agency that a license isn't currently suspended, even if the physical card looks perfect. This speeds up the "Counter Process" and ensures the driver is legally insured.

## Third-Party Use

**Police Officers (Roadside)**
Where barcode scanners or direct DMV queries exist, those remain the primary path. Live Verify is more plausible in lower-capability visual or copy-based checks than as the replacement for native law-enforcement tooling.

**Employers (HR Departments)**
**Driving Jobs:** Verifying the "Commercial Endorsements" of a truck driver before they operate a multi-million dollar fleet vehicle.

**Hotels / Check-In**
**Guest Verification:** Ensuring that the ID provided during check-in is authentic, reducing "Credit Card Chargeback" fraud built on stolen identities.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake ID" Fraud Problem**

- **Birthdate Alteration:** Minors using "High-Quality Fakes" to buy alcohol or enter bars.
- **Suspension Hiding:** A driver who lost their license keeping the physical card to fool employers or police.
**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State DMVs:** (The primary authority in the USA).
**National Ministries of Transport:** (In unified-system countries, e.g., DVLA in the UK).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Identity data is the ultimate target for hackers. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Dictionary Attacks" using voter rolls to find specific people's license numbers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

The DVLA issues UK driving licenses under the Road Traffic Act 1988.

```
✓ dvla.gov.uk/verify — DVLA driving license service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Photo Return: Defeating Sibling Lending and High-Grade Clones

Verification responses can include the **DMV's authoritative photo** of the license holder — not just status, but the actual face on file.

**Why This Matters:**

| Attack | Without Photo Return | With Photo Return |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Sibling lending** | Bouncer glances at card photo, older sibling gets younger one into bar | Verification returns DMV's photo — obvious mismatch |
| **High-grade clone** | Perfect fake with fraudster's photo, all text hashes correctly | Text verifies, but returned photo doesn't match the clone's photo |

A minor can buy a fake ID with perfect holograms and a perfectly cloned barcode. But they **cannot make the DMV server return their face**. When the bouncer's phone shows a different person than the one holding the card, the game is over.

**The Doppelganger Attack (The "Woman in Cabin 10" Problem)**

Sophisticated identity fraudsters don't just clone cards — they search social media for facial lookalikes, recruit a doppelganger, then steal the victim's license details. The clone shows the doppelganger's (similar) face, and when verified, the returned photo is "close enough" to pass.

*This attack — finding lookalikes via social media facial matching — was dramatized in "The Woman in Cabin 10" (2025), where antagonists recruited a doppelganger to impersonate a billionaire.*

**Countermeasure: Geo-Anomaly Detection**

DMVs can monitor verification request patterns:
- License verified in Miami at 2pm, then Seattle at 3pm? Flagged.
- License verified at 15 different bars in one night across a city? Flagged.
- License verified repeatedly in a state the holder doesn't live in? Flagged.

Geo-checking won't stop a single clone use, but it detects systematic abuse — a cloned license being used by a fraud ring across multiple venues triggers investigation before the victim even knows their identity was stolen.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the DMV's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (license number, name, date of birth, license class, expiration date) — never plaintext driver information — providing non-repudiation of the driver's license.

## Competition vs. Barcode Scanners (PDF417)

| Feature | Live Verify | Barcode Scanner (Handheld) | Visual Inspection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the DMV. | **Self-Contained.** Trust the data *on* the card. | **Human.** Prone to error. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if suspended *today*. | **Static.** Only shows what was printed years ago. | **Static.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds photo to status. | **Medium.** Easy to "Clone" a real barcode onto a fake ID. | **Zero.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone browser. | **Specialized.** Requires expensive scanners or apps. | **Human Eye.** |

**Practical conclusion:** Barcode/PDF417 plus direct DMV access is usually the better primary architecture. Live Verify mainly helps when a relying party has only the visible card or a copied image and still wants a lightweight bridge back to the issuer domain.
