## Data Verified

Certifying actuary name/qualifications (FCAS/ACAS), insurer name, specific line of business (e.g., Workers Comp, Auto, GL), total reserve amount (USD), valuation date, NAIC Annual Statement reference, actuarial range (high/low), date of opinion issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Statement of Actuarial Opinion (SAO):** The primary 1-page compliance filing.
- **Actuarial Report (Long Form):** Detailed technical backing (linked hash).
- **Schedule P Summary:** Showing historical loss development.
- **Qualified Opinion Letter:** (ALERT) if actuary has reservations about data.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Insurance Carrier or the Actuarial Audit Firm) and the filing status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Filed & Verified** — Opinion matches the official regulatory filing.
- **Under Correction** — Firm has noted a post-filing error in loss triangles.
- **Superseded** — Replaced by a newer audit or restatement.
- **In-Litigation** — Reserves challenged by state regulators or a receiver.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insurer's Board of Directors** benefits from verification.

**Solvency Assurance:** Proving to the Board that the $4.2B reserve figure is verified and vetted by an external or appointed actuary. This protects directors from "Breach of Duty" lawsuits if the company later goes into insolvency due to "Under-reserving."

**Reinsurance Recovery:** Providing verified hashes of loss opinions to reinsurers to trigger "Loss Portfolio Transfers" or to prove that the primary carrier is maintaining the "Skin in the Game" required by treaties.

## Third-Party Use

**State Insurance Commissioners (DOI)**
**Market Oversight:** Regulators can verify the authenticity of the actuarial signature and the specific reserve figures. Live Verify prevents a carrier from submitting a "Realistic" version to their reinsurer and a "Rosy" version to the state.

**Rating Agencies (A.M. Best / Moody's)**
**Capital Adequacy:** Verifying the actuarial opinion underlying the carrier's credit rating. A verified "Reasonable Range" check allows for more accurate rating actions.

**Investment Analysts**
**Equity Valuation:** Ensuring the "Reserve Releases" reported in earnings calls match the verified actuarial opinions filed with regulators.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Reserve Smoothing" Fraud Problem**

- **Liability Deflation:** Manually editing a $5B reserve to $4B in the PDF to make the company look more profitable or to avoid a "Capital Call" from regulators.
- **Hiding Qualifications:** Deleting the actuary's warning about "Inadequate Data" or "Adverse Deviation" to appear safer than the reality.
- **Actuary Impersonation:** Creating a fake SAO using the name of a famous CAS Fellow who never actually saw the data.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**P&C Insurance Carriers.**
**Actuarial Audit Firms:** (Milliman, Willis Towers Watson, KPMG).
**State Departments of Insurance.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Actuaries assess the adequacy of insurance loss reserves for accounting and solvency.

```
✓ lro.milliman.com/verify — Issues loss reserve opinions for insurers
  ✓ frc.org.uk/actuaries — Regulates UK actuarial standards and practice
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the loss reserve opinion.

## Competition vs. SERFF Public Search

| Feature | Live Verify | SERFF / State Public Search | Scanned PDF Memo |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Actuary/Insurer. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper in the boardroom. | **Slow.** Requires finding the NAIC # and navigating Gov UI. | **Instant.** |
| **Immediacy** | **Real-time.** Shows if firm retracted opinion. | **Laggy.** Depends on annual filing cycles. | **Static.** |
| **Detail** | **High.** Shows specific line-of-business limits. | **Low.** Often only shows aggregated totals. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Negotiation" reality. Reserve audits involve thousands of pages of "Loss Triangles" and Actuarial Memos. Negotiators don't have time to cross-reference every page with a slow government portal. Live Verify turn the **Physical Report** into a live, trusted clinical link, ensuring the "Financial Safety Net" is as strong as it looks on paper.
