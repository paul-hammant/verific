## Framing Insights

**Specific consequences (Pattern E):** An oncologist who begins chemotherapy based on a pathology report that has been altered — "Grade 2" changed to "Grade 3," or a benign finding edited to malignant — subjects the patient to months of toxic treatment they do not need. Conversely, a patient who edits a malignant result to benign to avoid treatment, then presents the altered report to a new doctor, delays life-saving intervention. In both directions, the unverifiable paper report is the weak link between the laboratory finding and the clinical decision.

**"Why would you bother?" (Pattern A):** Insurance fraud and denial drive most alterations. A patient scrubs a positive drug test before a custody hearing. A pilot edits a cardiac finding to pass a flight physical. A disability claimant adds findings that do not exist to support a claim. A life insurance applicant removes a cancer diagnosis to qualify for coverage. The lab's internal system is unaltered, but the paper that travels to the third party is trivially editable.

## Data Verified

Patient name, MRN/Accession number, specimen type (e.g., Blood/Tissue), specific test names, numerical results (e.g., TSH levels), qualitative diagnosis (e.g., "Malignant"), reference ranges, pathologist name/license, collection date, report date.

**Document Types:**
- **Pathology Report:** The high-stakes "Biopsy Result."
- **Standard Lab Panel:** (CBC, Lipid, Metabolic).
- **Toxicology Report:** Proving "Clean" or "Positive" status.
- **Genetic Screen:** Complex multi-page DNA analysis.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`questdiagnostics.com`, `labcorp.com`) and current report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Report is complete and verified by the medical director.
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** Original result was corrected; this version is void.
- **Preliminary** — Initial findings only; do not base surgery on this version.
- **Cancelled** — Specimen was compromised; no result issued.

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient** benefits from verification.

**Second Opinions:** Proving to a specialist at a different hospital (e.g., MD Anderson) that the "Grade 2" diagnosis isn't a misprint. A verified hash from the original lab provides the consulting doctor with instant trust, bypassing the need for a manual wait for physical slides or redundant re-tests.

**Personal Health Records:** Carrying a verified, cryptographically trusted "Source of Truth" about their health, which can be shared with insurers or travel providers without revealing the entire medical history.

## Third-Party Use

**Specialist Physicians / Oncologists**
**Treatment Decisions:** Before starting chemotherapy or scheduling surgery, the doctor scans the pathology hash. "Verified by Quest" ensure the diagnosis hasn't been "Edited" by a patient in denial or a confused relative.

**Life & Disability Insurers**
**Risk Underwriting:** Verifying high-stakes health markers (like cancer staging) before issuing multimillion-dollar policies. Live Verify connects the underwriter directly to the performing lab.

**Clinical Trial Monitors**
**Eligibility Vetting:** Ensuring that participants in a lung cancer trial actually have the "Verified Grade 2" diagnosis required by the protocol.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Medical Denial" Fraud Problem**

- **Diagnosis Scrubbing:** A patient editing a "Positive" cancer report to "Negative" to pass a life insurance exam or to hide a condition from a family member.
- **Result Padding:** Editing a "Normal" drug test to hide the presence of controlled substances.
- **Pathologist Impersonation:** Creating a fake report on the letterhead of a reputable lab to justify an experimental or unauthorized treatment.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Reference Labs:** (Quest, LabCorp, ARUP).
**Hospital Labs:** (Academic medical center pathology units).
**Direct-to-Consumer Labs:** (e.g., Everlywell, Thorne).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Pathology data is the most sensitive PII. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific people with cancer or rare diseases.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

NHS pathology labs test specimens and issue reports following UK medical device regulations.

```
✓ pathology.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk — Tests pathology specimens in UK hospitals
  ✓ ukas.com — Accredits UK testing laboratories
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the laboratory's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (specimen ID, test type, result status, report date, pathologist ID) — never patient name, diagnosis details, or medical history — providing non-repudiation of the test results and an audit trail insurers and clinicians can inspect.


## Competition vs. Patient Portals / HIEs

| Feature | Live Verify | Patient Portal (MyQuest) | Health Info Exchange (HIE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lab. | **System-Bound.** Requires login. | **Network-Bound.** |
| **User Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper in the clinic. | **Slow.** Requires patient to log in and find PDF. | **Difficult.** Requires clinical integration. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Diagnosis*. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **High.** |
| **Cross-System** | **Universal.** Works across any health system. | **Siloed.** Hard to share with non-network doctors. | **Limited.** Regional only. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Clinical Handoff." Surgeons and Oncologists often meet patients who bring paper reports from outside labs. They don't have time to log into the patient's private Quest account. Live Verify turns the **Physical Pathology Report** into a live, trusted clinical link that provides "Oncology-Grade" trust in seconds.
