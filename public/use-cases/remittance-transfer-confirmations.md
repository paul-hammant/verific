## What is a Remittance Confirmation?

In global finance, a **Remittance Confirmation** (or Receipt) is the proof that money was sent across borders—typically from a worker in a high-income nation to their family in their home country. These receipts (carrying an **MTCN** or reference number) act as "Digital Cash" that can be picked up at any participating agent location.

Because these papers are essentially vouchers for cash, they are high-stakes targets for fraud. Scammers use "Fake Receipts" to trick people into sending goods or "processing fees" for a lottery win that doesn't exist. Similarly, a dishonest person might "edit" a receipt to show a $5,000 transfer instead of $50 to trick an immigration officer or a lender. Verified hashes bind the **MTCN, Receiver Name, and Amount** to the provider's domain (e.g., `westernunion.com` or `moneygram.com`).

## Data Verified

MTCN (Money Transfer Control Number), sender name, receiver name, origin country, destination country, transfer amount (USD), exchange rate, payout amount (local currency), fees paid, date/time of transfer, agent location ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Send Receipt:** Given to the person who paid the cash.
- **Payout Receipt:** Signed by the receiver at the destination.
- **Statement of History:** Aggregate report for immigration/tax purposes.
- **Refund Confirmation:** (Linked hash) proving money was returned.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`wu.com`, `moneygram.com`, `wise.com`) and the transfer standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Available for Pickup** — Money is waiting at an agent location.
- **Paid / Picked Up** — **ALERT:** The cash has already been collected; this paper is now worthless.
- **Refunded** — **ALERT:** The sender cancelled the transfer and took the money back.
- **Held / Fraud Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The transfer is blocked for compliance review.

## Second-Party Use

The **Sender / Receiver** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Scam Protection:** A person buying a laptop on Facebook Marketplace is sent a "Photo of a Western Union Receipt" as proof of payment. The seller scans the hash. If it returns **"PAID"** or **"REFUNDED,"** they know the buyer is trying to scam them with an old or cancelled receipt, potentially saving them from a $1,000 loss.

**Pickup Speed:** A receiver at a busy agent in Mexico City scans their own receipt. "Verified by WU" ensures the agent that the MTCN is valid and the payout amount is accurate, bypassing the 10-minute "Legacy System Search" and reducing errors in cash counting.

## Third-Party Use

**Immigration Authorities (USCIS / Consulates)**
**Proof of Support:** Immigrants often use verified remittance hashes to prove they are financially supporting their family back home, which is a key factor in many "Hardship Waiver" cases. Verified hashes ensure the support is real and not a "Photoshop Fabrication."

**Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs)**
**Money Laundering Audit:** Verifying the "Integrity of the Chain." Instead of requesting 1,000 separate records, an auditor can scan the verified hashes provided by a large agent. This ensures the "Paper Logs" match the "Digital Ledger," stopping "Smurfing" fraud.

**Banks & Lenders**
**Income Vetting:** Using verified remittance history as a "Secondary Credit Score" for unbanked individuals, allowing them to qualify for loans based on their verified payment behavior.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Z-Receipt" Fraud Problem**

- **MTCN Re-Use:** Selling the same physical receipt to multiple people as "proof" of payment.
- **Amount Inflation:** Changing a $50 transfer into a $5,000 one on a printed PDF to meet a wealth requirement.
- **Ghost Transfers:** Creating fake "MoneyGram" emails to trick people into paying a "Fee" to release a larger non-existent sum.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Remittance Brands (Western Union, MoneyGram).**
**Fintech Apps (Wise, Remitly, Revolut).**
**Postal Banking Services.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Remittance data is sensitive financial PII. The hash must be salted to prevent "MTCN Harvesting" or tracking the wealth-flow of individual immigrant families.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Western Union is a licensed money transfer provider regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017.

```
✓ westernunion.com/transfer/verify — Money transfer provider processing cross-border remittances
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK payment service providers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Remittance is the "Invisible Economy." By turning paper receipts into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the most vulnerable participants in the global financial system from the multi-billion dollar cost of fraud and predatory scams.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the remittance provider's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (MTCN, sender/receiver names, amount, date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the transfer confirmation.
