## What are Solar Efficiency Certificates?

In the renewable energy industry, a **Solar Efficiency Certificate** (or Flash Test Report) is the "Birth Certificate" for a photovoltaic (PV) panel. It records the exact electrical output of a specific panel under **Standard Test Conditions (STC)**—measuring its Wattage (e.g., 400W) and its conversion efficiency percentage (e.g., 21.5%).

These certificates are the foundation of **Solar Financing** and **Warranties**. Fraud is common in the "Budget Solar" market: shady distributors often "edit" a certificate to turn a low-efficiency generic panel into a high-performance "Tier-1" brand like SunPower or LG. Similarly, they might inflate the wattage to charge a homeowner more for a smaller system. Verified hashes bind the **Panel Serial Number, STC Wattage, and Testing Date** to the manufacturer's or the testing lab's domain (e.g., `trinasolar.com` or `tuv.com`).

## Data Verified

Panel serial number, model name/number, testing date, peak wattage (Pmax), module efficiency percentage, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Isc), fill factor, testing lab ID, IEC/UL certification standard codes.

**Document Types:**
- **Flash Test Report:** The record for an individual panel.
- **Certificate of Conformance (CoC):** Proof for a whole shipping lot.
- **Efficiency Label:** The sticker on the back of the panel.
- **Warranty Certificate:** (Linked hash) the 25-year performance guarantee.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`trinasolar.com`, `jinkosolar.com`, `tuv.com`) and the panel standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Grade-A** — Panel matches the original factory flash-test.
- **Warranty Active** — Confirms the panel is registered for performance protection.
- **Recalled** — **CRITICAL:** The specific batch has been flagged for safety/performance defects.
- **Counterfeit Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The serial number does not exist or was used on a different model.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner / System Owner** benefits from verification.

**Performance Audit:** After a $20,000 solar installation, the homeowner scans the labels on their roof. "Verified by Trina Solar" ensures them that the installer actually used the high-efficiency 425W panels they paid for, and didn't swap them for cheaper 350W panels to pocket the difference.

**Home Resale Value:** When selling a home with solar, the owner provides the verified hashes of the panel certificates. The buyer can instantly see **"VERIFIED 21.8% EFFICIENCY"** on their phone, allowing the seller to justify a higher home price based on verified energy-production potential.

## Third-Party Use

**Green Energy Lenders (Banks)**
**Collateral Vetting:** Before releasing a $50,000 "Green Loan," the bank scans the verified flash-test hashes. This ensures the loan is backed by high-tier, insured assets that will actually produce the energy needed to repay the debt.

**Solar Installers / EPCs**
**Inventory Integrity:** A large installer receiving 5,000 panels for a commercial project can bulk-verify the hashes. This ensures they aren't being sent "Grade-B" panels by a wholesaler that are masquerading as "Grade-A."

**Insurance Underwriters**
**Loss Adjustment:** After a hail storm, the insurer verifies the original efficiency of the damaged panels. Verification ensures they are paying for high-end replacements and not "rounding up" the value of generic gear.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Wattage Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Efficiency Inflation:** Changing a 19% efficiency rating to 22% on a PDF to qualify for a government "Solar Rebate."
- **Brand Mimicry:** Printing fake "Tier-1" stickers and placing them over the labels of un-branded, lower-quality panels.
- **Serial Recycling:** Using a single valid flash report for 100 different panels.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Panel Manufacturers (OEMs).**
**Independent Testing Labs (TÜV, Intertek, PVEL).**
**National Energy Registries.**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Solar performance is generally public business data. However, individual homeowner names associated with specific panels should be salted to protect consumer privacy.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

MCS certifies solar panel installations and manufacturers under UK microgeneration standards.

```
✓ mcs.org.uk/cert — Issues solar efficiency certificates
  ✓ mcs.org.uk — Certifies UK microgeneration installations
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Solar is a "25-Year Investment." By turning static certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the billions of dollars in green capital and ensure that the "Clean Energy" on the roof is backed by the professional truth of the factory.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive manufacturers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (panel serial number, model name/number, testing date, peak wattage, module efficiency percentage, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, testing lab ID, IEC/UL certification standard codes) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the solar efficiency certificate.
