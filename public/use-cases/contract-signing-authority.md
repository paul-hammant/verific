## What is Contract Signing Authority?

Not everyone in a company can sign contracts that legally bind the organization. **Signing authority** is the formal delegation allowing specific individuals to commit the company to contractual obligations — up to defined limits.

When you're about to sign a major deal, you need to know: does the person across the table actually have authority to bind their company? If they don't, you might have an unenforceable agreement.

## The Company Policy Declaration

The strongest version of this use case is not just individual authority claims — it is a **company-wide policy declaration** that all officers carry verifiable authority claims, and that nothing outside the verified claims is recognised.

The company publishes a policy statement (on its website, in its terms of business, in its supplier onboarding materials):

> All officers and employees of Northbridge Services Ltd carry verifiable authority claims. Before relying on any commitment made on our behalf, check the officer's claim at `verify:northbridge.com/authority/`. If a person claims to act on our behalf and cannot produce a verifiable authority claim at that domain, we do not recognise their commitment.

This shifts the default. Without the policy, a counterparty who deals with an unauthorized person may invoke "apparent authority" — the legal doctrine that the company held someone out as authorized. With the policy, the company has explicitly told the world: **check the claim, and if there isn't one, don't rely on it.**

**Key design points:**

- **The company does not publish a directory of all authorized people.** That would be a security and competitive intelligence risk. There is no browsable list at `northbridge.com/authority/`.
- **The individual officer carries the claim.** They present it to the counterparty, who verifies the hash. The company publishes the hash at its domain but does not expose a roster.
- **Absence is the signal.** If an officer cannot produce a verifiable claim, the counterparty knows to escalate before committing. The claim's absence is pre-emptive disownment.
- **Revocation is immediate.** When an officer leaves the company, is demoted, or has their authority reduced, the endpoint returns REVOKED or the new, narrower claim. The former officer's old claim stops verifying instantly — no waiting for business cards to be collected or LinkedIn titles to be updated.

## Purchasing Authority

Contract signing authority is one layer. **Purchasing authority** — the ability to commit the company to spending — is a related but separate delegation:

- **Purchase order limits** — "Jane can raise POs up to £50,000. Anything above requires finance director approval."
- **Capital expenditure** — "The operations director can approve capex up to £100,000 per item."
- **Supplier onboarding** — "Only procurement can commit to a new supplier relationship."

A supplier receiving a £200,000 PO from Jane can verify whether she actually has authority to commit that amount. If her verifiable claim shows a £50,000 limit, the supplier knows to ask for escalation before shipping goods.

The mockup for purchasing authority follows the same pattern as contract signing:

## The Self-Inflation Problem

Some authority disputes are honest mistakes — someone genuinely believes they can sign. But others are deliberate:

- **The ambitious employee** — wants to close a deal bigger than their authority allows, hoping the company will ratify it after the fact because unwinding would be expensive. They assure the counterparty "I can sign this" knowing they can't.
- **The departing employee** — knows they're leaving and commits the company to obligations they won't be around to manage. By the time the company discovers it, the employee is gone and the commitment is made.
- **The shell-company operator** — represents a small company as bigger than it is, claiming authority over resources or commitments the company can't actually back. A verifiable authority claim that shows the real scope — "purchase orders up to £5,000" — punctures the inflation instantly.
- **The consultant or agent** — claims to represent a company with broad authority when their actual delegation is narrow (e.g., authorized to negotiate but not to commit).

In each case, the counterparty's defence is the same: **ask for the verifiable authority claim before relying on the commitment.** If the claim doesn't cover what's being promised, escalate. If there's no claim at all, the company's policy declaration means the commitment isn't recognised.

## The Authority Problem

**Common disputes:**

| Scenario | What happens | Consequence |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **No authority** | Manager signs contract they can't authorize | Contract may be voidable |
| **Exceeded limits** | £200K authority, signed £500K deal | Enforceable to £200K? Litigation. |
| **Expired authority** | Former director signs after leaving | Company denies liability |
| **Wrong entity** | Signed for subsidiary, not parent company | Wrong legal entity bound |
| **Restricted terms** | Authority excludes indemnities, contract includes them | Partial enforceability dispute |

**The legal doctrine:** "Apparent authority" may protect the counterparty if the company held someone out as authorized. But proving apparent authority is expensive litigation — better to verify upfront.

## Data Verified

**Authorized person name**, **company name**, **company registration**, **role/title**, **contract types authorized**, **monetary limits**, **duration limits**, **specific exclusions**, **delegating authority** (board resolution reference), **validity period**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Current authority in force
- **Expired** — Past validity date
- **Revoked** — Withdrawn before expiry (role change, termination, misconduct)
- **Suspended** — Temporarily inactive
- **Superseded** — Replaced by updated delegation

## Contract Types and Typical Authority Levels

| Contract Type | Typical Authority Holder | Common Limits |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **NDAs** | Senior managers and above | Often unlimited (low risk) |
| **Sales contracts** | Sales directors, commercial leads | Revenue-based limits |
| **Procurement contracts** | Procurement, finance | Expenditure limits |
| **Employment contracts** | HR directors, hiring managers | By grade/salary band |
| **Property leases** | CFO, CEO, or board only | High risk — often reserved |
| **Financing agreements** | CFO, board | Usually board reserved |
| **M&A documents** | Board only | Always reserved matter |

## Third-Party Use

**Counterparties** — Verify before signing (especially large deals)
**Law firms** — Due diligence on transaction authority
**Lenders** — Confirm borrower representatives have authority
**Auditors** — Test delegation controls
**Insurance (D&O)** — Claims relating to unauthorized actions

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Framework | Key Points |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **UK** | Companies Act 2006, common law | Directors have statutory authority; delegation must be within articles |
| **US** | State corporate law, agency law | Varies by state; Delaware most common for corporations |
| **EU** | National company law | Some countries require notarized powers of attorney for certain contracts |
| **Civil law countries** | Often stricter formalities | May require specific form of delegation, registered powers |

**Cross-border deals:** When contracting with foreign entities, local law determines authority requirements. Verification is especially valuable — reduces reliance on unfamiliar legal regimes.

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Counterparties can't easily verify if signatory has authority
- Authority documents are often confidential, not shared
- Disputes emerge years later when deals go wrong
- Former employees may still appear authorized externally

**The Fix:** Company issues signing authority confirmations to authorized individuals. Before signing material contracts, counterparty requests verification. Instant confirmation of current authority and limits.

**The negotiation flow:**
1. Deal reaches signature stage
2. Counterparty: "Please provide signing authority confirmation"
3. Signatory shares verification URL
4. Counterparty scans → sees exact authority limits
5. If contract is within limits → proceed
6. If contract exceeds limits → request escalation to higher authority

**Integration with legal tech:** E-signature platforms could require verification URL before accepting signature on contracts above certain thresholds.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Companies issue signing authority confirmations to verify that specific individuals have been delegated contract execution authority. Self-authorized by company governance and employment law.

```
✓ authority.example-corp.com/signing/verify — Issues contract signing authority confirmations
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuing company's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (authority ID, officer name and title, authorization scope, effective and expiration dates, delegation limits) — never internal compensation or veto provisions — providing non-repudiation of signing authority and an audit trail for contract disputes and due diligence reviews.
