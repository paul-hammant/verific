## What is a CGL Policy?

**Commercial General Liability (CGL)** is the "Slip and Fall" insurance for a business. It protects a company if they are sued for bodily injury or property damage (e.g., a contractor accidentally burns down a client's garage).

The **Declarations Page** is the 1-page summary showing the "Limits" (e.g., $2,000,000 per occurrence).

Business owners must show these verified limits to win contracts. Fraudsters often "Inflate" their limits on a PDF (changing $500k to $2M) to qualify for big jobs they aren't actually insured for.

## Data Verified

Named insured, business description (Class Code), coverage limits (Occurrence/Aggregate), policy number, effective/expiration dates, deductible amount, issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Policy Declarations Page:** The 1-page summary of coverage.
- **Binder:** Temporary 30-day proof of coverage.
- **Endorsement Schedule:** Listing specific changes (e.g., adding a project).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`travelers.com`, `chubb.com`) and current policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Policy is active and premiums paid.
- **Cancelled** — Coverage has been terminated (often due to non-payment or high claims).
- **Lapsed** — Renewal was not processed.
- **Pending Audit** — Coverage active but final premium subject to payroll audit.

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Owner** (second party) receives the policy declarations page from the carrier (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the liability coverage. Most of the time, the document sits in their insurance files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the coverage matches what the carrier's system recorded and the policy hasn't been cancelled.

**Future Optionality:** If questions arise—whether for contract awards, lease negotiations, or compliance checks—they have cryptographic proof of coverage ready without needing to contact the carrier.

## Third-Party Use

The business owner (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**General Contractors (GCs)**
**Subcontractor Compliance:** Ensuring that every sub on the job-site is fully insured. Verification prevents the "Buy and Cancel" fraud where a sub buys a policy to get on-site and then cancels it immediately.

**Lenders / Banks**
**Risk Mitigation:** Verifying the CGL coverage of commercial borrowers to ensure they won't be bankrupted by a single lawsuit, which protects the lender's loan.

**Event Venues**
**Vendor Management:** Verifying the liability insurance of caterers, decorators, and performers before they set up on the property.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Limit" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Policies:** Buying a policy, printing the papers, then cancelling it for a refund.
- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $500k policy to read $2M to win a contract.
- **Class Code Fraud:** Claiming to be a "Florist" (low risk) to get a cheap rate, but showing a "Verified" looking paper to work as a "Steel Erector" (high risk).

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Commercial Carriers (Travelers, Chubb, Zurich, Hartford)
- Managing General Agents (MGAs)
- Self-Insured Groups

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. CGL policy declarations contain many unpredictable variables: business names, unique policy numbers, specific coverage limits (exact dollar amounts), business descriptions and class codes, effective/expiration dates, deductible amounts, and carrier identifiers. The combination of these policy-specific details creates sufficient entropy to prevent hash enumeration attacks.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Carriers must be licensed by state insurance regulators to issue commercial liability policies.

```
✓ cgl.travelers.com/verify — Issues commercial general liability policies
  ✓ insurance.ca.gov — Regulates insurance companies in California
    ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy numbers, coverage limits, business descriptions, policy dates) — never business financial details, loss histories, or underwriting notes — providing non-repudiation of the policy it issued.

## Competition vs. Broker Confirmation Calls

| Feature | Live Verify | Manual Broker Call | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Human.** Relies on the broker's assistant answering honestly. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often takes 24-48 hours for a return call. | **Instant.** |
| **Availability** | **24/7.** Works on weekends/holidays. | **Business Hours Only.** | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds every digit. | **Vague.** "Yes, they have a policy." | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Site Entrance" reality. A subcontractor arrives at a job-site on a Saturday morning. The GC's office is closed. The Sub's broker is closed. Live Verify allows the site foreman to verify the Sub's insurance **on the spot**, allowing work to proceed safely and legally without delays.
