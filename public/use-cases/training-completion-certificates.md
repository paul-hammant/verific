## What is a Training Completion Certificate?

In the professional and industrial worlds, a **Training Completion Certificate** is the proof that a worker has the specific skills needed for a job—whether it's **Forklift Operation**, **Hazardous Materials Handling**, or **Anti-Harassment Compliance**. These documents are the primary evidence used during safety audits (like OSHA) and hiring.

The problem is that "compliance fatigue" leads to massive fraud. Shady employers or workers often "pencil whip" certificates, creating fake PDFs for training that never happened to avoid the cost of downtime. In high-risk fields, a fake safety certificate can lead to fatal accidents. Verified hashes bind the **Trainee Name, Course ID, and Completion Date** to the training provider's or the company's domain (e.g., `nsc.org`, `osha.gov`, or `walmart-academy.com`).

## Data Verified

Trainee name, employer name, course title, course ID, training date, expiration/recertification date, credit hours (CEU), instructor name/ID, academy accreditation number, certificate serial number.

**Document Types:**
- **Completion Certificate:** The formal "award" for framing.
- **Wallet Card:** For field verification (e.g., OSHA 10/30 cards).
- **Training Transcript:** (Linked hash) showing multiple course modules.
- **Attendance Roster:** Proof of physical presence in a classroom.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`nsc.org`, `redcross.org`, `coursera.org`) and the credential standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Current** — Trainee has passed the course and the record is active.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The skill certification has lapsed (e.g., CPR or HAZMAT).
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** The certificate was voided (e.g., due to cheating or failed re-test).
- **Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** This certificate number is part of a known "Fake Certificate" batch.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employee (Trainee)** benefits from verification.

**Job Portability:** When moving between contractors, a welder can provide the verified hash of their "Safety Certifications." The new employer can instantly see **"VERIFIED OSHA-30"** on their phone, allowing the worker to start on-site immediately without 2 days of redundant orientation.

**Career Advancement:** A professional can include a verified "Skills Badge" on their digital resume. "Verified by Coursera" or "Verified by NSC" provides the recruiter with the proof needed to shortlist the candidate over those with un-verified claims.

## Third-Party Use

**Corporate Safety Officers / Foreman**
**On-Site Vetting:** Before allowing a sub-contractor to operate a crane or enter a confined space, the foreman scans their verified hash. This ensures the worker is actually trained for that specific risk, protecting the company from multi-million dollar liability.

**Regulatory Inspectors (OSHA / HSE)**
**Audit Integrity:** During a surprise factory inspection, the agent scans random certificates on the breakroom wall. Live Verify ensures the company isn't "Fabricating" records to hide a lack of training, stopping "Paper Compliance" fraud.

**Insurance Risk Managers**
**Premium Auditing:** Verifying that 100% of a workforce has verified, active "Safety Training" before renewing a workers' compensation policy.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Training" Fraud Problem**

- **Hour Padding:** Changing a "1-hour webinar" into a "40-hour immersive course" on a PDF.
- **Date Stretching:** Altering a 2022 expiration date to 2026 to avoid the cost of re-training.
- **Template Mimicry:** Using a reputable academy's logo to vouch for training that never occurred.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Safety Organizations.**
**Vocational & Technical Schools.**
**Corporate Training Portals (LMS).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low to Medium. While training status is a professional credential, individual exam scores and employee IDs should be salted to protect worker privacy.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues training completion certificates

```
✓ training.example-corp.com/cert/verify — Issues training completion certificates
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Training is the "Code of the Workforce." By turning certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that "Job Readiness" is backed by cryptographic proof, protecting workers from danger and companies from the high cost of un-vetted labor.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive training providers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (trainee name, employer name, course title, course ID, training date, expiration/recertification date, credit hours, instructor name/ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the training certificate.
