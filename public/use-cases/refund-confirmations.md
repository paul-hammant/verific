## What is a Refund Confirmation?

A refund confirmation proves that money was returned to a customer, claimant, or account holder. This includes retail returns, insurance claim payments, tax refunds, warranty reimbursements, and chargeback resolutions.

Refund fraud is widespread: fake refund confirmations are used for double-dipping (claiming refund wasn't received), tax fraud, and warranty abuse.

## Data Verified

Issuer name, transaction/claim number, recipient name, original purchase or claim details, refund amount, refund method, processing date, receiving account (masked).

**Document Types:**
- **Return Refund:** Retail purchase returned for refund.
- **Warranty Reimbursement:** Out-of-pocket repair costs covered.
- **Insurance Claim Payment:** Claim settled and paid.
- **Tax Refund:** Government tax refund issued.
- **Chargeback Resolution:** Disputed charge resolved in customer's favor.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`bestbuy.com`, `irs.gov`) and refund status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Issued** — Refund processed and sent.
- **Deposited** — Confirmed received by recipient account.
- **Pending** — Refund approved but not yet processed.
- **Recalled** — Refund reversed due to fraud or error.
- **Partial** — Partial refund issued, remainder denied.

## Second-Party Use

The **Customer/Recipient** benefits from verification.

**Dispute Resolution:** When customers claim refunds weren't received, verified confirmation proves the refund was issued (shifting burden to their bank).

**Tax Documentation:** Warranty reimbursements and certain refunds have tax implications. Verified records support tax filings.

**Credit Card Disputes:** If a chargeback is filed after a refund was already issued, verified confirmation prevents double recovery.

## Third-Party Use

**Banks / Card Networks**
**Chargeback Defense:** Merchants defend chargebacks with refund evidence. Verified confirmations are more compelling than screenshots.

**Insurance Companies**
**Subrogation:** When recovering from responsible parties, insurers need verified proof of what was paid to the insured.

**Tax Authorities**
**Audit Support:** IRS may verify claimed refunds or reimbursements during audits.

**Accountants / Bookkeepers**
**Reconciliation:** Verified refunds help reconcile accounts receivable and track warranty obligations.

## Verification Architecture

**The Refund Fraud Problem**

- **Double-Dipping:** Claiming refund wasn't received after it was deposited.
- **Fake Refund Claims:** Forged refund confirmations for items never returned.
- **Tax Refund Fraud:** Fake IRS refund notices in phishing schemes.
- **Warranty Abuse:** Fake reimbursement claims to defraud manufacturers.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Retailers:** (Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy).
**Manufacturers:** Warranty and recall reimbursements.
**Insurance Companies:** Claim payments.
**Government:** (IRS, state tax agencies) tax refunds.
**Card Networks:** Chargeback resolutions.

**Return Fraud Prevention**

Retailers could include verification hashes on refund receipts. When customers file chargebacks claiming no refund was received, the verified hash proves otherwise.

**Tax Refund Authentication**

IRS refund notices are frequently spoofed in phishing attacks. Verified refund confirmations would let taxpayers confirm communications are genuine.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues order refund confirmations

```
✓ returns.amazon.co.uk/refund/verify — Issues order refund confirmations
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the refund confirmation.
