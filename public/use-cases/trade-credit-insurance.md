## What is Trade Credit Insurance?

In the B2B world, most sales happen on "Net-30" or "Net-60" terms—meaning the buyer gets the goods today but pays later. **Trade Credit Insurance (TCI)** protects the seller if the buyer goes bankrupt or simply refuses to pay. A **Credit Limit Notice** is the formal document where the insurer (e.g., Euler Hermes or Coface) approves a specific dollar amount of risk for a specific buyer.

These documents are the "Green Light" for global trade. Fraud is high-stakes: a dishonest buyer might create a fake "Atradius" limit-approval letter for $1 million to trick a supplier into shipping a massive load of electronics on credit. Similarly, a seller might "edit" an old approval to hide that the insurer has recently revoked coverage for a failing customer. Verified hashes bind the **Approved Credit Limit, Buyer Tax ID, and Expiration Date** to the insurer's domain (e.g., `allianz-trade.com` or `coface.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, insurer name, insured name, buyer name, buyer tax ID (DUNS/EIN), approved credit limit amount, maximum payment terms (e.g., 60 days), effective date, notice expiration date, currency, credit analyst ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Credit Limit Notice:** The approval for a specific customer.
- **TCI Policy Schedule:** The overarching contract.
- **Notice of Threat of Loss:** (Linked hash) reporting a late payment.
- **Claims Settlement Advice:** Proof of payout for a bad debt.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`allianz-trade.com`, `atradius.com`, `coface.com`) and the risk standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Approved** — The credit limit is currently in force and backed by the insurer.
- **Revoked / Zero-Limit** — **CRITICAL:** The insurer has withdrawn coverage for this buyer (indicates high insolvency risk).
- **Reduced** — **ALERT:** The approved amount has been lowered since the paper was printed.
- **Lapsed** — **ALERT:** The annual policy has expired; no new shipments are covered.

## Second-Party Use

The **Supplier (The Insured)** benefits from verification.

**Shipping Confidence:** Before loading a $250,000 container, the warehouse manager scans the "Credit Limit" hash. "Verified by Allianz" ensures them that the sale is 90% insured, allowing them to release the goods without waiting for a manual email from the finance department.

**Bank Financing:** Suppliers often borrow against their "Insured Accounts Receivable." By providing verified TCI hashes to their bank, they can prove that their "Collateral" is high-quality and backed by a top-tier insurer, potentially lowering their borrowing costs.

## Third-Party Use

**Invoice Factoring Firms / Banks**
**Risk Mitigation:** Before "Buying" an invoice from a supplier, the bank scans the verified TCI limit. Verification ensures that the invoice is actually covered by insurance, protecting the bank from a loss if the buyer fails to pay.

**Financial Auditors**
**Bad-Debt Reserve Audit:** Verifying that a company's "Insured Receivables" are actually backed by active, verified credit limits, ensuring that their balance sheet accurately reflects their risk exposure.

**Secondary Re-Insurers**
**Portfolio Vetting:** Verifying the "Granular Risk" of thousands of small credit limits within a large TCI portfolio before providing treaty re-insurance.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Limit" Fraud Problem**

- **Limit Inflation:** Changing a "$10,000" approval to "$1,000,000" on a PDF to trick a supplier into shipping a massive load of goods.
- **Status Masking:** Hiding a "Revocation Notice" from an insurer to continue shipping to a failing subsidiary.
- **DUNS Swapping:** Using an approval for a "Healthy Company" to cover for a "Zombie Company" with a similar name.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Credit Insurance Groups.**
**National Export Credit Agencies (ECAs).**
**Specialized Credit Management Platforms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Individual buyer names and their specific "Credit Limits" are sensitive business intelligence. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized trading partners.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Euler Hermes and trade credit insurers issue trade credit insurance policies and are regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance framework.

```
✓ tradecredit.eulerhermes.co.uk/verify — Trade credit insurer issuing credit limit approvals
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Trade credit is the "Fuel of the B2B Economy." By turning static limit notices into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the supply chain from the "Chain Reaction" of insolvencies and ensure that "Credit Power" is backed by the digital truth of the insurer.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive insurers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, insurer name, insured name, buyer name, buyer tax ID, approved credit limit amount, maximum payment terms, effective date, notice expiration date, currency, credit analyst ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the credit limit approval.
