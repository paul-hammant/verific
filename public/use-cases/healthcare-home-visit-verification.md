## What is a Visiting Nurse Badge?

When an elderly relative receives home health care, a nurse or aide enters their private home.

The **Care Professional Badge** is their "Security Token." It proves:
1.  **Identity:** The person at the door is the one the agency sent.
2.  **Licensure:** They are a verified Registered Nurse (RN) or Certified Aide.
3.  **Background:** They have passed a recent criminal background check.

"Fake Nurse" home invasions are a tragic reality. Scammers buy scrubs and fake IDs to gain entry into the homes of vulnerable seniors. But outright impersonation is not the only risk:

- **Worker substitution.** The agency schedules Nurse Williams but sends a different person — an unqualified aide, a trainee without the right registration, or someone who hasn't passed the required background check. The patient or family was told to expect one person; a different person arrives. The substitute may be well-meaning but may not hold the qualifications (RN vs. aide, specific clinical competencies) that the patient's care plan requires.
- **Expired or suspended registration.** The worker was qualified when the agency hired them, but their registration has since lapsed, or they are subject to conditions of practice that restrict what they can do. The agency's records may not be current. The patient has no way to know.
- **No background check or an outdated one.** The worker's DBS/background check was done years ago, or the agency cut corners on a new hire. The patient — often elderly, alone, and physically unable to resist — is admitting someone whose suitability hasn't been recently confirmed.

Verification at the door addresses all three: the badge carries the worker's name, photo, registration number, and current status. The photo catches substitution. The live status check catches expired or restricted registrations. The background-check status (where the agency includes it) catches the third.

Like utility and contractor doorstep checks, this is strongest because it is a threshold-decision use case: the household needs to know whether this specific worker is the qualified, background-checked professional the agency actually sent — not just whether someone from the agency turned up.

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the patient's or family member's perspective. The home visit is initiated by the care agency.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The agency controls access to ongoing care — refusing entry or challenging a worker risks disrupting treatment for a vulnerable person who depends on it.

**Verification asymmetry:** The household is being asked to admit a stranger immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the person at the door is the licensed, background-checked professional the agency actually sent.

## Data Verified

Worker name, photo (hash), professional license type (RN, LPN, CNA), state license number, agency name, scheduled visit ID, background check clearance date, current duty status (Active/Off-Duty).

**Document Types:**
- **Healthcare ID Badge:** Carried by the visiting professional.
- **Visit Authorization Letter:** Sent to the patient pre-appointment.
- **Proof of Clearance:** Background check summary for domestic staff.
- **Skill Certification:** Specialization proof (e.g., wound care or pediatric).

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Worker is on-duty, licensed, and authorized
- **SUSPENDED** — Professional license or agency status has been retracted; do not admit
- **OFF_DUTY** — Shift ended; worker should not be entering private homes
- **ALERT** — Badge reported lost/stolen
- **404** — Badge not found (terminated, never issued, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `bayada.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, the endpoint can return optional actions for the patient or family:

```
HTTP 200 OK

Status: OK

--- Optional Follow-Up ---

Are you a patient or family member?
You may record details of this health-care-worker interaction.
You will NEVER be told not to do this or that it is not needed.

POST to: https://bayada.com/verify/visit-report/VIS-2026-402

Fields:
- Your relationship: [Patient / Family member / Next of kin / Other]
- Setting: [Home visit / Hospital ward / Clinic / Care home / Other]
- Date/time of interaction
- Was identification shown?
- Quality of care: [Excellent / Good / Concerns]
- Any concerns or issues?
- Request callback from patient services? [Y/N]
```

This applies whether the interaction is a home visit, on a hospital ward, in a care home, or any other medical setting. The patient or next of kin can record their perspective regardless of location.

**Why This Matters:**

- **Write-only patient record:** Patient or family creates their own contemporaneous record of the interaction—independent of the provider's notes
- **Pattern detection:** Worker receiving frequent "concerns" across multiple patients triggers review
- **Abuse deterrent:** Workers know patients and families can easily report; reduces opportunity for mistreatment
- **Remote family visibility:** Next of kin can verify caregivers and log observations even when not physically present
- **Documentation for disputes:** "I recorded every interaction" is powerful evidence if something goes wrong later
- **Staffing evidence:** Healthcare workers benefit too—if units are understaffed, a high volume of logged patient interactions provides evidence for increasing staffing levels. Workers should *want* every interaction recorded.

**The "Never Discouraged" Principle:**

The message explicitly states recording is *always* appropriate. This prevents:
- Workers pressuring patients ("don't bother, it's just routine")
- Patients feeling they're being difficult or ungrateful
- Family members feeling they're overstepping

Every report is logged. The agency can triage later—but the patient/family is never told their input isn't wanted.

## Second-Party Use

The **Home Visit Worker (Nurse/Aide)** benefits from verification.

**Personal Safety:** Proving to a defensive family member or a security guard at a gated community that they are a legitimate healthcare professional. Verification reduces the chance of "Suspicious Person" calls to the police.

**Credential Portability:** Proving their "Verified Active" status when picking up shifts through different staffing registries or agencies.

## Third-Party Use

**Vulnerable Patients (Elderly/Alone)**
**Abuse Prevention:** Before opening the door, a patient or their remote family member (via doorbell cam) can scan the nurse's badge. "Verified by Bayada" ensures the person at the door isn't a "Fake Nurse" home-invader or a predator with a fake uniform.

**Gated Community Security**
**Access Control:** Guards can instantly verify that the "Visiting Nurse" actually has a scheduled appointment in the complex, preventing unauthorized access.

**Secondary Insurers**
**Fraud Detection:** Verifying that a "Home Health Visit" actually occurred and was performed by a verified, licensed professional before paying out a claim.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Nurse" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Burglars buying realistic-looking "Nurse Scrubs" and fake ID lanyards to gain entry into the homes of elderly people who live alone.
- **Licensure Hiding:** A caregiver who had their license revoked for drug theft keeping their physical ID badge to continue finding work through private Craigslist ads.
- **Agency Spoofing:** Creating a fake "Home Health Agency" website to provide "Verified" IDs for un-vetted, un-insured workers.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Health Systems:** (Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic).
**Specialist Care Agencies:** (Bayada, Home Instead, BrightStar Care).
**State Nursing Boards:** (Hosting the official license hashes).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Worker and patient association data is sensitive. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Stalking" attacks where someone tries to track a nurse's daily route.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Home health agencies issue care professional badges under healthcare regulator authority (CQC in the UK).

```
✓ homevisit.nhs.uk/verify — Issues home visit worker identification
  ✓ cqc.org.uk — Regulates health and social care services in England
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the care agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (worker names, license types, license numbers, scheduled visit IDs, duty statuses) — never sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of worker verification.

## Competition vs. Agency Phone Lines

| Feature | Live Verify | Calling the Main Office | Static ID Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Agency. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering or "fake numbers." | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to license. | **Vague.** "Yes, Sarah works here." | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often takes 5-10 minutes on hold. | **Instant.** |
| **Availability** | **24/7.** Works for "Late Night" emergency visits. | **Restricted.** Offices often closed at night. | **N/A.** |

**Why this remains strong:** The threshold moment is the real workflow. Patients decide whether to let someone into their home in seconds and often do not want to make a phone call while an official-looking visitor waits at the door. Agency systems remain primary in the background, but the badge is the visible surface at that moment. That makes this a strong complementary home-entry verification case.
