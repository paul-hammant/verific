## What is a Title Insurance Policy?

A **Title Insurance Policy** is a specialized contract that protects a property owner (or lender) against financial loss from defects in title—things like hidden liens, forged deeds, or "Missing Heirs" who might claim they own your house.

Unlike other insurance that covers *future* events (like fire), title insurance covers *past* errors. It is the "Warranty of Ownership."

**"Policy Scrubbing"** is a sophisticated fraud where a seller or shady developer "edits" a title policy PDF to remove **Schedule B Exceptions**. For example, they might delete a line showing a $50,000 IRS tax lien or a "Shared Driveway" easement. They then present this "Clean" policy to a buyer or a bank to close a sale illegally. Live Verify binds the **Policy Number and the specific list of Exceptions** to the underwriter's domain.

**Why verification matters here:**

- **Hidden liens become the buyer's problem.** A $50,000 IRS tax lien or a $30,000 contractor's lien removed from the Schedule B exceptions means the buyer discovers — after closing — that the property has debts attached to it that must be satisfied before it can be resold or refinanced.
- **Easement surprises block construction.** A removed "shared driveway" easement or utility right-of-way means the buyer discovers they cannot build the extension, fence, or pool they planned — after they have already paid for architectural drawings and permits.
- **Title insurance is supposed to be the safety net.** The entire point of the policy is to enumerate the exceptions. If the exceptions list has been tampered with, the buyer's understanding of what is covered and what is excluded is wrong. A verified hash of the policy confirms the underwriter's actual exceptions, not an edited version.

## Data Verified

Policy Number, Named Insured (Owner/Lender), Amount of Insurance, Property Address/Parcel ID, Effective Date, Specific Schedule B Exceptions (e.g., "Easement 14"), Underwriter ID, Issuing Agency.

**Document Types:**
- **Owner's Policy:** Protecting the person buying the home.
- **Lender's Policy:** Protecting the bank's mortgage interest.
- **Title Commitment:** The "Promise to Insure" issued before closing.
- **Endorsement:** (Linked hash) for specific changes (e.g., adding an ADU).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the National Underwriter) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active/Enforceable** — Policy is verified and matches the underwriter's master record.
- **Endorsed** — Policy has been modified (linked hash to latest endorsement).
- **Claim Pending** — **ALERT:** A title claim has been filed against this policy.
- **Void/Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Policy was retracted due to non-payment or fraud.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner** benefits from verification.

**Future Resale:** Proving to a future buyer's attorney that you have a "Verified Clean" title policy from 10 years ago. This speeds up the new title search and may reduce the "Reissue Rate" cost for the next policy.

**Mortgage Refinance:** Providing a verified hash to a new lender to prove the property is already fully insured, fulfilling a mandatory requirement for funding the new loan.

## Third-Party Use

**Buyer's Attorneys**
**Integrity Checks:** Before closing, the buyer's lawyer scans the seller's existing policy. "Verified by FirstAm.com" ensures the seller hasn't "Photoshopped" out a major boundary dispute or a recorded lien.

**Lenders and Underwriters**
**Liability Handoff:** Ensuring that the "Lender's Policy" provided at closing is 100% authentic and hasn't been tampered with by a shady title agent.

**Real Estate Appraisers**
**Marketability Assessment:** Verifying that a property has a standard, un-restricted title policy, ensuring there are no "Hidden Defects" that would lower its appraised value.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Clean Schedule" Fraud Problem**

- **Exception Deletion:** Removing a line from Schedule B that mentions a "Shared Well" or a "Right of First Refusal" to make the property more attractive to a buyer.
- **Coverage Inflation:** Editing a $100,000 policy to read $1,000,000 to trick a lender into an over-leveraged mortgage.
- **Phantom Agencies:** Fraudsters setting up a fake "Local Title Agency" and issuing fake policies on stolen letterhead.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Title Underwriters:** (e.g., First American, Stewart, Fidelity National).
**State Title Guaranty Funds:** (In jurisdictions like Iowa).
**Real Estate Data Mirror Sites:** (e.g., DataTrace - hosting verified policy hashes).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Title underwriters must be licensed by state insurance regulators to issue title insurance policies.

```
✓ title.firstam.com/verify — Issues title insurance policies
  ✓ insurance.ca.gov — Regulates insurance companies in California
    ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive title underwriters' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (Policy Number, Named Insured, Amount of Insurance, Property Address/Parcel ID, Effective Date, Schedule B Exceptions) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the policy document and issuer liability.


## Competition vs. Physical Policy Jackets

| Feature | Live Verify | Physical Jacket (Folder) | Online Public Records |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tamper Detection** | **High.** Protects the "Exceptions" text. | **Zero.** The paper inside the folder is easily swapped. | **Data-Only.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Underwriter. | **Brand-Bound.** Trust the logo. | **Gov-Bound.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Manual.** requires deep reading. | **Slow.** requires search. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows "Claim" status. | **Zero.** Paper is a snapshot. | **N/A.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Schedule B" reality. Title policies are 30-page documents filled with fine print. No one reads them all. Live Verify turns the **Schedule A/B Summary** into a live, trusted digital proof, ensuring that "Clear Title" is a cryptographically verified fact at every real estate closing.
