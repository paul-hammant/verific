## What is an ESTA?

If you are a citizen of a "Visa Waiver" country (like the UK, Japan, or France), you don't need a formal visa to visit the US for vacation. Instead, you need an **ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization)**.

This is a digital permit that links your passport to the US border system. You apply online, and if approved, you print out a **Confirmation Notice**.

Airlines are fined thousands of dollars for every passenger they let onto a plane without a valid ESTA. But the real source of truth is already the government's live status system. That makes ESTA a weak fit for standalone document verification: the better answer is usually easier access to the official status page or API, not a new printable verification layer.

## Data Verified

Application number, full name, date of birth, passport number, country of citizenship, authorization status (Approved/Pending), issuance date, expiration date.

**Document Types:**
- **ESTA Approval Printout:** The standard PDF for travelers.
- **Group Application Summary:** For families traveling together.
- **Status Change Notice:** Proving an old authorization was cancelled.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cbp.dhs.gov`) and current travel standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Traveler is authorized to board a carrier to the U.S.
- **Cancelled** — Authorization retracted (e.g., due to visa ineligibility).
- **Expired** — The 2-year validity period has ended.
- **Pending** — Under manual review (usually resolved in 72 hours).

## Second-Party Use

The **Traveler (Citizen of VWP Country)** benefits from verification.

**Airline Boarding:** In the narrow case where a traveler is holding only a printout and the carrier lacks a smoother official lookup flow, verification can act as a convenience wrapper around the official status record.

**Travel Administration:** A traveler or travel arranger can use the printout as a quick human-readable reference, while understanding that the real authority remains the official CBP status.

## Third-Party Use

**Airlines (International Carriers)**
The ideal answer is direct carrier integration with the official CBP status system. Live Verify would only be a convenience wrapper around that official state, not a replacement for it.

**Embassies / Consulates**
**Secondary Vetting:** If they look at a printout at all, it should only be as a convenience surface. The substantive check still belongs in official government systems.

**Private Security / Event Organizers**
This is weak as a core use. If legal-entry status matters, direct official documentation or official system checks are better.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Approval" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated PDFs:** Scammers creating fake "ESTA Approved" letters for people who are ineligible (e.g., due to a criminal record or travel to a restricted country).
- **Date Alteration:** Editing the "Expiration Date" on a 2024 approval to make it look like it's valid for a 2026 trip.
- **Passport Swapping:** Editing the name or passport number on a valid approval to match a different person.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):** The sole issuer.
**DHS SAVE System:** (The backend cross-reference).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Passport numbers and names are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific travelers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Authorizes visa-free travel for citizens of eligible countries.

```
✓ esta.cbp.dhs.gov/verify — Authorizes visa-free travel for citizens of eligible countries
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the authorization it granted.


## Competition vs. CBP Online Status Check

| Feature | Live Verify | ESTA Official Website | Scanned PDF / Printout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Binds Passport to Status. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at check-in. | **Slow.** Requires typing Application # or Passport # + DOB. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to `cbp.dhs.gov`. | **High.** But prone to phishing sites. | **Low.** Easily faked. |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Technical.** Requires laptop/stable 5G. | **Visual.** |

**Practical conclusion:** ESTA is primarily a direct-status-access problem. If convenience is the issue, the right fix is a shorter official check flow, airline integration, or a link/QR into the official page. Live Verify would only be a thin convenience layer over that existing source of truth.
