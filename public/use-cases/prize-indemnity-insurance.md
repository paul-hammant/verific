## What is Prize Indemnity Insurance?

In the world of marketing and sports, **Prize Indemnity Insurance** allows a company to offer a life-changing prize (e.g., "$1 Million for a Hole-in-One" or "Half-Court Shot") without actually having the money. The sponsor pays a small premium to an insurer, who agrees to pay the prize if someone actually wins.

These documents are the "Proof of Payout." Fraud is rampant in "Small-Town Contests." A dishonest sponsor might claim they have insurance to lure in participants, but they actually have a fake "Zurich" or "Lloyd's" policy. If someone wins, the sponsor disappears, and the winner is left with a worthless piece of paper. Verified hashes bind the **Prize Amount, Event Date, and Required Witnesses** to the specialist insurer's domain (e.g., `hiscox.com` or `beazley.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, insurer name, sponsor name, event name/location, event date, prize amount, specific contest rules (e.g., yardage, target size), mandatory witness requirements, video surveillance requirements, premium payment status, broker ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Prize Insurance:** Posted at the contest site.
- **Master Policy Schedule:** The full list of exclusions.
- **Winner Claim Form:** (Linked hash) proving the win was reported.
- **Witness Affidavit:** (Linked hash) verified statements from observers.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`hiscox.com`, `beazley.com`, `lloyds.com`) and the policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Funded** — Premium is paid; prize will be honored if won.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The contest date has passed.
- **Claim Filed** — **ALERT:** A winner has been reported for this prize.
- **Invalid / Void** — **CRITICAL:** Policy was cancelled (e.g., due to sponsor non-payment).

## Second-Party Use

The **Winner / Participant** benefits from verification.

**Winner Confidence:** If a regular person hits a $1M hole-in-one, the sponsor may try to "negotiate" them down to $10,000. The winner can scan the verified hash of the insurance certificate. "Verified by Hiscox" gives the winner the cryptographic proof that a $1M check is actually available, providing leverage to demand the full payout.

**Participant Safety:** Before paying a $100 entry fee for a "Million Dollar Sweepstakes," a participant scans the verified hash. If it returns **"ACTIVE,"** they know the prize is real. If it returns **"UNKNOWN,"** they avoid a lottery scam.

## Third-Party Use

**Contest Adjudicators / Referees**
**Integrity Audit:** Before the first ball is hit, the head official scans the certificate hash. Verification ensures that all "Mandatory Conditions" (like camera placement) match the insurer's requirements, preventing a "Technical Denial" of a legitimate win later.

**State Gaming Commissions**
**Sweepstakes Oversight:** Verifying that "Large Prize" marketing campaigns in their jurisdiction are actually backed by solvent insurance carriers, protecting consumers from "Ghost Sweepstakes."

**News Media / Journalists**
**Human Interest Vetting:** Before reporting on a "Miracle Million Dollar Win," a journalist can scan the verified hash to ensure the story isn't a publicity stunt by a sponsor who never intended to pay.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Miracle Denial" Fraud Problem**

- **Hidden Exclusions:** Editing a PDF to remove a "No Professionals" clause to help a friend win a prize.
- **Prize Inflation:** Changing a $10,000 prize to $1,000,000 on a poster to attract more entries.
- **Phantom Insurer:** Creating a fake policy from a non-existent company like "Global Prize Trust LLC."

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Specialty Insurance Carriers (Lloyd's Syndicates).**
**Specialized Prize Brokers.**
**Online Sweepstakes Platforms (e.g., Omaze).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low to Medium. While event names are public, the specific payout terms and premium costs are sensitive business data.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

SportsCover issues prize indemnity insurance and is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance framework.

```
✓ prize.sportscover.com/verify — Prize and contingency specialist insurer
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Prize indemnity is the "Trust of the Big Win." By turning certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that "Once-in-a-Lifetime" moments are backed by cryptographic certainty, protecting the winner's life-changing event from corporate deception.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the specialty insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the certificate.
