## What is a Proof of Funds (POF) Letter?

A **Proof of Funds (POF)** letter is a document issued by a bank or financial institution proving that a person or company has the cash available to complete a transaction. It is the "Pass" needed to enter high-stakes markets like **Real Estate**, **Fine Art Auctions**, or **M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions)**.

Because a POF is the difference between an offer being accepted or rejected, it is a primary target for fraud. Scammers use "Inspect Element" on their online banking to turn a $1,000 balance into $1,000,000, or they buy fake "Bank Letters" from illegal dark-web services. Verified hashes bind the **Available Balance, Account Holder Name, and Issuing Officer** to the bank's domain (e.g., `chase.com` or `goldmansachs.com`).

## Data Verified

Account holder name, available liquid balance, currency type, account type (e.g., Savings/Money Market), date of issuance, issuing bank/branch, bank officer name/title, specific purpose (e.g., "Real Estate Purchase").

**Document Types:**
- **Proof of Funds Letter:** The 1-page summary from a bank officer.
- **VOD (Verification of Deposit):** A formal bank-to-bank summary.
- **Account Snapshot:** A verified printout of a current balance.
- **Escrow Funding Commitment:** (Linked hash) proving funds are already in a trust account.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`chase.com`, `morganstanley.com`, `ubs.com`) and the balance standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Current** — Balance matches the bank's digital snapshot at the time of issuance.
- **Balance Mismatch** — **CRITICAL:** The amount on the paper has been altered from the bank's record.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** This POF is more than 30 days old; a fresh snapshot is required.
- **Inactive** — **ALERT:** The account has been closed or funds moved since issuance.

## Second-Party Use

The **Buyer / Offeror** benefits from verification.

**Offer Acceptance Speed:** In a competitive real estate market (e.g., "Cash Buyer" wars), the buyer provides the verified hash of their POF. The seller's agent can instantly see **"VERIFIED: $1.25M"** from a top-tier bank, giving them the confidence to accept the offer without waiting for a manual bank-to-bank call.

**M&A Credibility:** When a startup attempts to buy a competitor, they show the verified hash. "Verified by Goldman Sachs" ensures the target's Board of Directors that the "Financing" isn't a bluff, allowing negotiations to proceed to the next stage.

## Third-Party Use

**Real Estate Listing Agents (Sellers)**
**Buyer Vetting:** Instead of manually calling 5 different banks to verify "Pre-Qual Letters," the agent scans the hashes. Verified hashes eliminate the risk of "Fake Cash Offers" that tie up a property for weeks before failing to close.

**Escrow and Title Companies**
**Anti-Fraud Audit:** Verifying that the funds the buyer *claims* to have in their bank actually exist before opening an escrow file, stopping "Wire Fraud" setups where scammers use fake POFs to gain access to escrow instructions.

**Auction Houses (Sotheby's / Christie's)**
**Bidding Eligibility:** Instantly verifying the "Bidding Power" of a paddle-holder before they are allowed to bid on a $10M painting.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Inspect Element" Fraud Problem**

- **Balance Padding:** Changing a $12,500 balance into a $1,250,000 balance on a PDF.
- **Snapshot Fraud:** Borrowing money from a relative for 24 hours, printing a POF, then returning the money immediately (verification reveals the "Inactive" or "Balance Changed" alert).
- **Officer Spoofing:** Creating a fake letter from a non-existent bank employee with a fake LinkedIn profile.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Retail & Private Banks.**
**Wealth Management Firms.**
**Escrow Holders.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Individual wealth data is extremely sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Wealth Mapping" or the targeting of high-net-worth individuals by scammers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Barclays issues proof of funds letters and is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK money laundering and financial services framework.

```
✓ pof.barclays.co.uk/verify — Bank issuing proof of funds verification letters
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK banks and deposit-takers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Proof of Funds is the "Ticket to the Game" in high-value commerce. By turning bank letters into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the marketplace from "Phantom Buyers" and ensure that "Proof of Wealth" is backed by the digital truth of the ledger.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the bank's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (account holder name, available balance, date of issuance, issuing bank/branch) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the proof of funds letter and an audit trail banks can inspect.
