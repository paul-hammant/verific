## What is Utility Worker Verification?

Criminals posing as **Utility Workers** (Gas, Electric, Water) is one of the most common methods for gaining entry to private homes for burglary, assault, or "Shakedown" scams. These fraudsters often target the elderly, claiming a "Gas Leak" or an "Urgent Meter Inspection" to bypass locks.

Legitimate utility workers often have badges that are easily forged with a home printer. Even if the badge is real, the resident has no way of knowing if the worker is actually on a scheduled shift or if their employment was terminated yesterday.

Live Verify allows a homeowner to scan the worker's ID badge to verify: **"Is this person an active employee of this specific utility, and is there a valid service order for this address today?"**

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the homeowner's perspective. The visit is initiated by the utility company's field operations.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The utility can shut off gas, electricity, or water, and can charge for missed or refused access — consequences the homeowner cannot easily ignore.

**Verification asymmetry:** The homeowner is being asked to grant entry immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the worker is a current employee with a valid service order for this address.

**Why would you bother checking?** Because they need to enter your property. An external meter reader who stays at the meter box is low-risk. But when the worker needs to come inside — to access an internal meter, inspect pipework, or work in the basement — you are granting a stranger access to private space. The person who turns up may not be the person dispatched: a terminated employee keeps their badge, or a subcontractor sends an unvetted worker. The verification response includes a `photo_url` field — the badge verifies as "OK" but the face doesn't match, and the substitution is caught at the door.

## Data Verified

Worker name, employee ID, company name, service specialization (Gas/Electric/Steam), photograph (via hash), expiration date, background check status, vehicle fleet number.

**Document Types:**
- **Employee ID Badge:** Worn on the lanyard.
- **Service Order / Job Ticket:** Printed or on-tablet proof of work.
- **Notice of Entry:** Left on the door for scheduled maintenance.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Worker is currently on shift and assigned to field tasks
- **VERIFIED_DISPATCH** — (If linked to order) A service order exists for this address today
- **TERMINATED** — Person is no longer an employee; do not admit
- **FRAUD_ALERT** — This ID has been flagged for misuse
- **404** — Badge not found (forged, expired, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `coned.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, homeowners may record the visit:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

--- Optional Follow-Up ---

You may record details of this utility visit.
You will NEVER be told not to do this or that it is not needed.

POST to: https://coned.com/customer-feedback/visit

Fields:
- Service type: [Meter read / Gas inspection / Electric repair / Other]
- Areas accessed: [Exterior only / Basement / Interior / Backyard]
- Duration: [Less than 10 min / 10-30 min / Over 30 min]
- Any concerns or issues?
- Request callback from customer service? [Y/N]
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Scam deterrent:** Workers know homeowners can record the visit; reduces opportunity for theft or extortion
- **Pattern detection:** Worker receiving frequent "concerns" across multiple addresses triggers HR review
- **Dispute resolution:** If damage or theft occurs, there's a contemporaneous record of who accessed what areas
- **Access log:** Creates homeowner-controlled record independent of utility's internal logs

**The "Never Discouraged" Principle:**

Workers should never tell homeowners "don't bother" or "that's not necessary." Every report is logged. The utility can triage later—but the homeowner is never made to feel their input isn't wanted.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner / Resident** benefits from verification.

**Vulnerable Population Protection:** An elderly person living alone receives a knock from a "Gas Inspector." Instead of opening the door, they ask the worker to hold their ID to the window. They scan it and see **"ACTIVE DUTY: David Chen"** on their phone, allowing them to safely grant access.

**Anti-Scam:** A "Water Dept" worker demands $100 to "Fix a high-pressure valve" immediately. The resident scans the ID. If it returns **"OFF DUTY"** or **"UNKNOWN,"** they know it's a shakedown and call the police.

**Privacy:** Residents can verify the worker's authority without needing to call a busy call center or providing their own account details to the worker.

## Third-Party Use

**Police Departments**
**Scam Investigation:** When a "Utility Scam" is reported, police can use the verified hashes to determine if the ID used was a forged version of a real employee or a completely fabricated entity.

**Apartment Building Security**
**Access Logging:** Front-desk staff can scan every utility worker who enters the building, creating a cryptographically verified log of exactly who had access to the building's infrastructure (pipes, wiring) and when.

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-Viz" Fraud Problem**

- **Camouflage:** Scammers wearing generic "Safety Green" vests and hard hats to look professional.
- **Fake Emergencies:** Claiming a "Gas Leak" to create panic and bypass resident caution.
- **ID Clipping:** Using a generic "Contractor" badge from an office supply store to impersonate a utility employee.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs).**
**Municipal Water/Power Departments.**
**Sub-contractor Firms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. The hash must be salted to prevent competitor reconnaissance or data harvesting of employee rosters.

## Rationale

Utility worker verification is about "Personal Safety at the Door." By allowing a resident to instantly cross-reference a physical badge with a digital corporate record, it neutralizes the primary weapon of home-invasion scammers: the fake uniform.

## Data Verified

Worker name, photo (hash), employee ID, company name (Utility/Surveying firm), specialized role (e.g., Meter Reader, Gas Leak Repair, Boundary Surveyor), current duty status (Active/On-Duty), background check clearance date (hash), issuing jurisdiction.

**Document Types:**
- **Employee ID Badge:** Carried by the utility worker.
- **Service Appointment Notice:** (Digital or paper) proving the authorized visit.
- **Land Surveyor License:** (Linked hash) for professional boundary setters.
- **Easement Entry Letter:** Proving the legal right to access a backyard.

## Verification Response (Meter Readers/Surveyors)

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Worker is currently working and authorized to be at a customer's home
- **SUSPENDED** — Access revoked due to safety or disciplinary review; do not admit
- **OFF_DUTY** — Shift ended; worker should not be entering private properties
- **INVALID** — Badge reported lost or serial mismatch
- **404** — Badge not found (forged, terminated, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `field.coned.com`).

## Second-Party Use

The **Field Worker (Technician/Surveyor)** benefits from verification.

**Personal Safety:** Proving their identity to a defensive homeowner or a neighborhood watch group. Verification reduces the chance of a homeowner calling the police or confronting the worker with a weapon when they are in a backyard for authorized work.

**Job Efficiency:** Speeding up access to commercial basements or utility rooms. Security guards can verify the badge hash in seconds, bypassing the need for a manual "Phone Confirmation" with the utility dispatch center.

## Third-Party Use

**Homeowners (Vulnerable Residents)**
**Burglary Prevention:** Before opening the gate or front door, a resident can ask to see the badge through a window or doorbell camera. Scanning the hash confirms the person is a "Verified On-Duty" worker, preventing the common "Fake Utility Worker" scam used by burglars to case interiors or commit home invasions.

**Neighborhood Watch Groups**
**Community Vetting:** Instantly verifying the credentials of strangers seen walking between backyards with surveying equipment or "Checking Meters."

**Real Estate Developers**
**Contractor Audit:** Ensuring that only authorized and active personnel from the utility company are on a complex construction site.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Tech" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Burglars buying realistic high-visibility vests and fake "Utility" lanyards online to gain entry to homes to steal or case the interior.
- **Credential Hiding:** A terminated employee keeping their physical ID to maintain access to high-value areas or to continue "working" privately for cash.
- **Scope Misrepresentation:** A meter reader pretending they have the authority to "Check the pipes inside the house" to gain access to a private residence.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Utility Companies:** (Electric, Gas, Water, Telecom).
**Surveying & Engineering Firms.**
**Municipal Public Works Depts.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Worker locations and names are high-value targets. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Stalking" attacks where someone tries to track a specific technician's daily route.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Utility worker IDs are issued by licensed utilities and regulated by the UK energy market authority.

```
✓ field.britishgas.co.uk/verify — Issues utility field worker badges and field access authorizations
  ✓ ofgem.gov.uk — Regulates UK energy markets
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Privacy-Preserving Badge Design

Meter readers and field technicians have brief, high-volume interactions — 30-60 seconds per property, 50+ visits per day. Their badge is visible to every homeowner, neighbor, and passerby. Full name exposure creates unnecessary privacy risk.

**Badge shows:** First name + last initial + ID number (e.g., "Marcus M 1847")

**Verification returns:** Photo, current duty status, authorized work type, employer domain

**Why this works:**
- **Homeowner gets what they need:** Photo match + confirmation worker is on-duty for this utility
- **Worker privacy protected:** Full name not exposed at every doorstep and recorded by doorbell cameras
- **Accountability preserved:** Utility company maintains full employment records; disputes and incidents traceable via ID
- **Audit trail intact:** All verifications logged by the courier company

For longer engagements (e.g., a surveyor spending hours on a property boundary dispute), full credentials may be appropriate. But for routine meter reads, privacy-preserving IDs suffice.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the utility's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (worker ID, duty status, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing field worker credentials.


## Competition vs. Uniforms / Phone Calls

| Feature | Live Verify | Uniform & Clipboard | Calling Dispatch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Company. | **Visual.** Trusted only via logo. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to status. | **Zero.** Uniforms are easily bought. | **Variable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **N/A.** Just looking. | **Slow.** Often takes 10-20 minutes on hold. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if banned *today*. | **Static.** | **N/A.** |

**Why this remains strong:** The threshold moment is the real workflow. Residents decide to open their gate or door in seconds and often do not want to make a phone call while a stranger waits on the porch. Dispatch and company systems remain primary in the background, but the badge is the visible surface at the decision point. That makes this a strong complementary doorstep-verification case.
