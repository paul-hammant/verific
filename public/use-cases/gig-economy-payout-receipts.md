## What is a Payout Receipt?

For millions of Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash drivers, their "Paycheck" is a weekly **Payout Receipt** in the app.

Because gig workers are "Self-Employed," they must show these receipts to landlords to rent an apartment or to banks to get a car loan. They are the only verified proof of income.

Fraud is common: drivers often edit a $400 payout to read $4,000 to trick a landlord into thinking they are high-earners. Live Verify allows a landlord to scan the receipt and see the **verified, un-altered weekly income** directly from the platform's domain.

## Data Verified

Driver name, Partner ID, payout period (dates), gross trip earnings, total tips, promotions/bonuses, service fees deducted, net payout amount, total trip count, date of payment.

**Document Types:**
- **Weekly Earnings Statement:** The primary income proof for drivers.
- **Trip Receipt:** (Linked hash) for individual high-value rides.
- **1099-K / 1099-NEC:** (Linked hash) for annual tax filings.
- **Mileage Summary:** For tax deduction verification.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`uber.com`, `lyft.com`, `doordash.com`) and current payout status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Completed** — Funds have been successfully transferred to the driver's bank.
- **Processing** — Payout calculated but transfer en route.
- **Amended** — A correction was issued (e.g., due to a late tip or fee adjustment).
- **Void** — Payout retracted due to fraud or account dispute.

## Second-Party Use

The **Gig Worker (Driver/Courier)** benefits from verification.

**Lease Applications:** Proving to a landlord that their $1,242/week income is verified by Uber. Landlords are often skeptical of "Self-Employed" income; a verified hash from the platform's domain removes this doubt and speeds up the "Move-In" process.

**Loan Approval:** Providing verified payout history to a car lender or bank to secure a loan. Verification allows for "Algorithmic Lending" where the bank trusts the platform's data more than a plain PDF.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Banks**
**Income Verification:** Lenders verify the stability and amount of "Gig Income." Live Verify ensures the applicant hasn't "Photoshopped" their earnings higher to qualify for a larger loan.

**Tax Preparers / IRS**
**Audit Defense:** Ensuring the "Gross Income" reported on the tax return matches the verified payouts from the platform, reducing audit friction.

**Insurance Companies**
**Premium Rating:** Verifying the "Total Mileage" and "Trip Count" for commercial auto policies or gig-specific gap coverage.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Earnings Inflation" Fraud Problem**

- **PDF Alteration:** Changing a $400 payout to $4,000 to trick a landlord into believing the person is a high-earner.
- **Tip Fabrication:** Adding fake "Tips" to a receipt to hide illegal income or to inflate creditworthiness.
- **Identity Theft:** Using a high-earning friend's payout statement and editing the name to pass a background check.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Gig Platforms:** (Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart).
**Payroll Processors:** (e.g., Stripe, Marqeta).
**Aggregators:** (e.g., Argyle, Pinwheel - who host verified worker data).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Gig economy platforms issue payout receipts documenting earnings and payments to workers. Self-authorized by their role as intermediary payment processors and platform operators.

```
✓ drivers.uber.com/earnings/verify — Issues gig economy payout receipts and earnings statements
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the gig platform's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (driver names, partner IDs, payout periods, gross earnings, tips, promotions, fees, net payouts, trip counts) — never pickup/dropoff addresses or passenger details — providing non-repudiation of the statement and earnings and an audit trail tax authorities and financial regulators can inspect.

## Competition vs. Employment Verifiers (Argyle)

| Feature | Live Verify | Argyle / Pinwheel (API) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Worker shares only the *Statement*. | **Low.** API access often reveals *full* account history. | **High.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Platform. | **System-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any platform with a URL. | **Limited.** Only for platforms on the API network. | **Universal.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires worker to find login/pass and link accounts. | **N/A.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Consent Gap." Many gig workers are hesitant to give their Uber password to a third-party "Aggregator" app. Live Verify provides **API-level trust** for a single document, preserving the worker's privacy and security while giving the lender the verification they need.
