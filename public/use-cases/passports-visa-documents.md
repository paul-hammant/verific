## What is a Passport?

A **Passport** is your "Global Identity Card." It is the most powerful travel document in the world, proving both your identity and your citizenship. A **Visa** is the official permission granted by a *foreign* country allowing you to enter their borders for a specific purpose (work, study, or tourism).

Beyond the airport, passports are used as the "Primary ID" for:
1.  **Opening Bank Accounts:** Satisfying strict AML/KYC laws.
2.  **Renting High-Value Assets:** Cars, apartments, or luxury equipment.
3.  **Cross-Border Business:** Signing contracts as a foreign entity.

**"High-Grade Clones"** are a major security threat. Sophisticated forgers can replicate holograms, security paper, and even RFID chips. But the strongest passport verification still belongs inside the passport's native machine-readable ecosystem: chip reads, MRZ checks, and official government systems.

The Live Verify use case is narrower. It is for **third-party relying parties outside formal government verification channels**: hotels, employers, landlords, banks, remote onboarding teams, and background-check providers. Those parties often receive a scan, PDF, or phone photo of the data page but do not have chip-reading hardware or direct access to border-grade systems. In that setting, Live Verify turns the **Data Page Copy** into a live link back to the issuing authority's status.

## Data Verified

Full name, Nationality, Date of Birth, Passport Number, Document Serial Number, Issuing Authority ID, Place of Birth, Expiration Date, MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) checksums, Photo (via secure hash).

**Document Types:**
- **Standard Passport:** The foundational data page.
- **Entry/Exit Visa:** Full-page stickers for foreign entry.
- **Residency Permit (BRP):** Long-term stay authorization.
- **Emergency Travel Document:** Temporary 1-way paper for lost passports.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`gov.uk`, `state.gov`, `singpass.gov.sg`) and the live security status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Passport is authentic and in good standing.
- **Reported Stolen/Lost** — **ALERT:** Bearer has reported this physical book missing.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** Citizenship or travel rights have been terminated.
- **Replaced** — A newer passport version exists for this person (common in clone detection).

## Second-Party Use

The **Passport Holder (Traveler)** benefits from verification.

**Digital Onboarding:** Proving their identity to an online bank or crypto exchange in seconds. A verified hash allows the bank to trust the "Data Page" without requiring the user to record a 3D "Video Selfie" (which many find invasive and buggy).

**Remote Work / Visas:** Providing a verified digital copy of their passport to a foreign employer, ensuring the HR team that the document is authentic without mailing the physical book across borders.

## Third-Party Use

**Hotels and Hospitality**
**Remote Copy Trust:** A hotel receiving a passport image during pre-arrival check-in can verify that the copied data page still maps to an issuer-backed record rather than trusting a bare JPEG sent over email or chat.

**Employers / Background Checks**
**Identity and Work-History Support:** A foreign employer or screening firm reviewing a passport copy can verify that the document is not an obvious fabrication or stale replacement before proceeding to deeper checks.

**Banks / KYC Teams**
**Copy-of-Passport Workflows:** Many KYC teams still receive uploaded passport scans during onboarding. Live Verify gives them a stronger authenticity and status signal without requiring full passport-reader hardware.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Copied Data Page" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Using a real person's data on a cloned book with a different photo.
- **Status Hiding:** Sending a scan of a passport that has since been reported lost, replaced, or revoked.
- **Scan Reuse:** Reusing an old passport image in onboarding flows long after a replacement document was issued.
- **The Doppelganger Attack:** Using a valid passport belonging to a similar-looking person. Live Verify with **Photo Return** (returning the official face on file) helps non-government verifiers detect this faster.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Passport Agencies:** (HM Passport Office, U.S. State Dept).
**Consulates / Embassies:** (For Visas and CRBAs).
**International Aviation Bodies:** (ICAO PKD integration).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Passport data is the "Crown Jewels" of identity. The hash MUST be salted to prevent foreign intelligence or hackers from "Mass Mapping" a population's travel documents.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

```
✓ hmpo.gov.uk/verify — Issues and renews UK passports
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Photo Return: Stronger Copy-of-ID Checks

Verification responses can include the **issuing authority's authoritative photo** of the holder — not just status, but the actual face on file.

**Why This Matters:**
A sophisticated forger can perfectly replicate holograms and security paper. But they **cannot forge what the government server sends back**. When a hotel, employer, or KYC analyst sees a returned photo that does not match the submitted document or the live selfie they requested, the fraud is exposed.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuing government's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (passport number, document type, issuing country, expiration date) — never biometric data or full passport information — providing non-repudiation of passport issuance.


## Competition vs. NFC (Electronic Passports)

| Feature | Live Verify | NFC / e-Passport | Scanned PDF / Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Use Case** | **Third-party copy verification.** Good for uploaded scans and PDF workflows. | **Gold standard.** Best when native passport-reading infrastructure is available. | **Weak.** Easy to forge and replay. |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera or OCR-capable workflow. | **Restricted.** Requires NFC-capable devices and chip-reading support. | **Universal.** |
| **Verifier Access** | **Broad.** Useful for hotels, employers, banks, and screening teams. | **Limited.** Best suited to formal travel and government workflows. | **Broad.** But untrusted. |
| **Status Signal** | **Good.** Issuer-domain response can show replacement or revocation state. | **Strong.** Native passport trust path. | **None.** Static copy only. |

**Why Live Verify fits here:** It is the bridge for relying parties who handle passport copies outside the native passport ecosystem. It should not replace NFC or official border systems; it fills the gap where the verifier only has a copy and no access to passport-reader infrastructure.
