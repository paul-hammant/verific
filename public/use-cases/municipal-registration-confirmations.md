## What is a Municipal Registration Confirmation?

A municipal registration confirmation proves that a person, business, vehicle, or property is properly registered with local government. These registrations include business licenses, dog licenses, voter registrations, vehicle registrations, and various local permits.

Municipal fraud includes fake business licenses to appear legitimate, forged registrations to avoid fees, and fraudulent permits to bypass requirements.

## Data Verified

Issuing municipality, registration type, registrant name, registration number, validity period, any conditions or restrictions, fees paid.

**Document Types:**
- **Business License:** Local permission to operate a business.
- **Vehicle Registration:** State/local vehicle registration.
- **Voter Registration:** Election registration status.
- **Pet License:** Animal registration and vaccination proof.
- **Alarm Permit:** Security alarm system registration.
- **Rental Registration:** Landlord/property registration.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`sf.gov`, `dmv.ca.gov`, `seattle.gov`) and registration status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Registration current and valid.
- **Expired** — Registration period ended.
- **Suspended** — Registration suspended for cause.
- **Revoked** — Registration cancelled.
- **Pending Renewal** — Renewal application in process.

## Second-Party Use

The **Registrant** benefits from verification.

**Legitimacy Proof:** Businesses can prove they're properly licensed to operate, building customer trust.

**Traffic Stops:** Vehicle owners can prove current registration if physical tags are missing or damaged.

**Voting Rights:** Voters can verify their registration status before elections.

**Pet Disputes:** Pet owners can prove current licensing and vaccination status.

## Third-Party Use

**Customers / Clients**
**Business Verification:** Before hiring contractors or engaging businesses, verify they hold required local licenses.

**Landlords**
**Tenant Verification:** Some areas require tenant registration verification.

**Insurance Companies**
**Coverage Verification:** Auto insurance requires current vehicle registration.

**Law Enforcement**
**Real-Time Verification:** Officers can verify registration status during encounters.

**Election Officials**
**Voter Roll Maintenance:** Cross-reference voter registrations across jurisdictions.

## Verification Architecture

**The Municipal Registration Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Business Licenses:** Operating without proper licensing using forged documents.
- **Expired Registrations:** Presenting expired documents as current.
- **Jurisdiction Fraud:** Using registration from one city while operating in another.
- **Fee Evasion:** Forged renewal receipts to avoid registration fees.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**City Government:** Business licenses, permits, local registrations.
**County Government:** Property-related registrations, court filings.
**State DMV:** Vehicle and driver registrations.
**Election Offices:** Voter registration.
**Specialized Agencies:** (Animal Control, Fire Department) specific registrations.

**Cross-Jurisdiction Challenges**

People move and businesses expand across jurisdictions. Verified registrations from multiple localities help establish complete compliance history.

**Real-Time Status**

Many municipal registrations can change status quickly (business closes, vehicle sold, license suspended). Verified lookups provide current status rather than relying on potentially outdated paper documents.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Local authorities maintain registration records and issue confirmations under the Local Government Act 1972.

```
✓ council.gov.uk/registration/verify — UK local authority registration and verification service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the municipality's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (registration number, registrant name, validity period, registration type) — never sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of registration issuance.
