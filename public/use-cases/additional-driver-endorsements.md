## What is a Driver Endorsement?

In the auto insurance industry, an **Additional Driver Endorsement** is the formal proof that a person who doesn't own the car is legally covered to drive it. This is common when lending a car to a friend for a road trip, adding a teenager with a learner's permit, or authorizing a visiting relative.

These documents are the "Permission to Drive." Fraud is high-frequency: individuals whose own insurance was cancelled for accidents often "edit" a friend's insurance card or PDF to add their own name, making them look insured to police or rental agencies. Verified hashes bind the **Additional Driver Name, License Number, and Validity Dates** to the insurer's domain (e.g., `geico.com` or `progressive.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, policyholder name, additional driver full name, driver's license number (masked), vehicle license plate, effective start date/time, expiration date/time

**Document Types:**
- **Additional Driver Endorsement:** (Form CA 20 01 equivalent) The primary proof.
- **Temporary ID Card:** Issued for the duration of the endorsement.
- **Rental Car Binder:** (Linked hash) specifically for a rental transaction.
- **Learner Driver Addendum:** Proof of coverage for students.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Hash matches, endorsement is valid
- **EXPIRED** — Coverage period has passed
- **CANCELLED** — Endorsement or base policy was terminated
- **404** — Hash not found (OCR error, or document not in system)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` URL in the document itself (e.g., `safeguard-ins.com`).

## How the Temp Driver Knows They're Covered

The person being added shouldn't just take the policyholder's word for it. Consider the scenario: a father-in-law claims with bravado that he's "added you to the policy" but never actually did. The son-in-law drives off uninsured.

**Workflow Options:**

1. **Direct Notification** — Insurance app asks for temp driver's email or phone number. The temp driver receives their own confirmation directly from the insurer:
   ```
   From: noreply@safeguard-ins.com
   Subject: You've been added to Robert Miller's policy

   You are now covered to drive the 2024 Tesla Model Y
   from 15 Mar 2026 to 22 Mar 2026.

   <span data-verify-line="bare3">verify:safeguard-ins.com/v</span>
   ```

2. **Show the App** — Policyholder shows their phone screen to the temp driver. A quick camera snap of the endorsement screen (with verify line visible) is sufficient proof—the temp driver can verify it themselves later.

3. **QR Code / Share Link** — Policyholder taps "Share" in their insurance app. Temp driver scans QR or receives a link, landing on a verification page that confirms their name and coverage dates.

4. **Temp Driver Self-Check** — Some insurers allow anyone to check coverage by entering policy number + driver name + DOB. Returns "Covered" or "Not Found."

The key insight: **verification removes social awkwardness**. The son-in-law doesn't have to call FIL a liar—they just say "mind if I snap the screen? I like to keep records." Then they verify independently.

## Second-Party Use

The **Additional Driver / Vehicle Owner** benefits from verification.

**Borrowing Peace of Mind:** Before handing over the keys to a $50,000 car, the owner scans the friend's digital endorsement. "Verified by Safeguard" ensures the owner that their friend is actually insured, protecting the owner's personal premiums from an un-insured accident.

**Roadside Stop Speed:** If pulled over by police while driving a borrowed car, the driver shows the verified hash. The officer can instantly see **"VERIFIED ACTIVE"** on their phone, removing the suspicion of a "Borrowed Car" theft or a fake insurance card.

## Third-Party Use

**Police / Traffic Enforcement**
**Fraud Detection:** During a traffic stop, the officer scans the endorsement hash. Verification ensures the PDF hasn't been "edited" to add a driver who is actually unlicensed or un-insured, stopping the high-volume fraud of "un-insured driver cards."

**Car Rental Agencies (e.g., Turo / Getaround)**
**Loss Control Audit:** Automatically verifying the insurance binders provided by "Guest Drivers." Verified hashes ensure that the insurance is primary and matches the specific dates of the rental booking.

**Insurance Claims Adjusters**
**Incident Investigation:** After an accident, the insurer verifies the exact "HH:MM:SS" of the endorsement activation to ensure the coverage wasn't bought *after* the crash occurred.

## QR, Share Links, and Public Verification URLs

A QR code often is faster to scan at a roadside stop. The real question is not "QR or Live Verify?" but "what does the QR resolve to, and can the verifier actually use it?"

| QR Contains | What SC Officer Can Do |
|-------------|------------------------|
| URL to Safeguard's agent portal | Nothing—no login credentials, access denied |
| Static embedded data (policy #, name) | Read it, but cannot verify it's authentic |
| Cryptographically signed token | Nothing—no shared PKI between insurers and police |
| Public verification URL | Works—but this is just Live Verify with different encoding |

**The real constraint:** There is no federation between 50 state DMVs, hundreds of insurers, and thousands of police departments. A QR pointing to Safeguard's internal system is useless to an officer with no Safeguard account.

Live Verify with a **public verification endpoint** handles this correctly:
- No integration required between insurers and police
- The domain (`safeguard-ins.com`) is the trust anchor
- Anyone with internet access can verify
- Works across state lines, insurer boundaries, and app ecosystems

QR can encode that same public URL, and in practice that may be the best surface. The verification model is identical; the real issue is whether the relying party lands on a public issuer-controlled status page rather than a closed insurer portal.

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, the endpoint can offer actions relevant to different verifiers:

**For the Temp Driver:**
```
HTTP 200 OK

Status: ACTIVE
(The driver, vehicle, and dates are already in the document you just verified)

[Save to Wallet]  [Request PDF Copy]  [Report a Problem]
```

**For Police / Roadside:**
```
HTTP 200 OK

Status: ACTIVE
Meets minimum legal requirements: YES

--- Log This Verification (Optional) ---
POST to: https://safeguard-ins.com/verify/log/END99228877

Fields:
- Officer badge number
- Agency name
- Verification context: [Traffic Stop / Accident / Checkpoint]
- Notes
```

**For Accident Scenarios:**
```
HTTP 200 OK

Status: ACTIVE

--- Initiate Claim (Optional) ---
POST to: https://safeguard-ins.com/claims/init/END99228877

Fields:
- Your insurance policy number
- Accident date/time
- Location
- Description
- Your contact info
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Paper trail:** Insurer knows their endorsement was verified at a traffic stop—useful if fraud is later alleged
- **Claim initiation:** Other party in an accident can start a claim without phone tag
- **Dispute evidence:** Timestamped verification proves coverage was checked *before* the accident, not after

**The Authentication Gap:** Anyone who sees the endorsement can verify it and submit reports. This is a feature, not a bug—in an accident, the *other driver* needs to verify your coverage. Low friction beats perfect authentication in roadside scenarios.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Post-Crash" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Hijacking:** Editing a "Clean" driver's certificate to put a "High-Risk" driver's name on it.
- **Date Stretching:** Changing a 3-day weekend endorsement to look like a 30-day monthly policy on a PDF.
- **Premium Evasion:** Hiding a driver with multiple DUIs from the insurer but showing their name on a fake paper endorsement to the car owner.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Personal Lines Carriers.**
**Regional Insurance Brokers (as sub-issuers).**
**Peer-to-Peer Mobility Platforms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Driver names and license numbers are sensitive PII. The hash must be salted to prevent "Driver Roster Scraping" by data brokers or competitors.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Direct Line underwrites additional driver endorsements for UK auto insurance policies.

```
✓ endorsement.directline.co.uk/verify — Underwrites additional driver endorsements for auto insurance
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Driver endorsements are the "permission slips" of the sharing economy. The strong version is not anti-QR or anti-link. It is simply that whatever surface is used should resolve to a public insurer-controlled verification path that works across state lines and outside closed insurer systems.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
