## What is Peer-to-Peer Sale Witnessing?

When Peter sells his MacBook to Mary via Craigslist, they meet at a Starbucks. The public venue provides **physical safety**, but nothing else. Mary has no recourse if:

- The laptop turns out to be stolen (obscured by a fresh OS install)
- Peter gave a fake name and burner phone number
- The serial number is flagged a week later when Mary tries to get AppleCare

This is a **notary for informal sales**—a witnessing organization that verifies identities and records the transaction, without touching the money.

## Data Verified

Transaction ID, date/time, location, seller identity reference, buyer identity reference, item description, serial number, condition, sale price.

**What the witness holds (identity escrow):**
- Government ID verification for both parties
- Contact information (phone, email, address)
- Photo taken at time of transaction

**What the receipt shows:**
- Anonymous identity references (not names/addresses)
- Full item details including serial numbers
- Timestamp and location

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the witnessing organization domain (`safesale.org`) and transaction status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Transaction occurred as recorded; both parties verified.
- **Disputed** — One party has filed a dispute (stolen goods, misrepresentation).
- **Resolved** — Dispute was resolved; may include outcome note.
- **Police Hold** — Law enforcement has requested identity disclosure.

## Second-Party Use

**The Buyer** benefits from verification.

**Post-Sale Recourse:** If Mary discovers the MacBook is stolen, she can contact the witnessing org. They relay messages to Peter without revealing his personal details. If Peter doesn't respond or refuses to make it right, Mary can escalate.

**Insurance Claims:** When filing a claim for a stolen item, the verified receipt proves Mary acquired it legitimately and paid $800.

**The Seller** also benefits.

**Proof of Sale:** If the item is later involved in a crime, Peter can prove he sold it on January 14th and is no longer in possession.

**Buyer Accountability:** If Mary tries to falsely claim the item was defective or misrepresented, the witnessed transaction record protects Peter.

## Third-Party Use

**Law Enforcement**

**Stolen Property Recovery:** Police recover a stolen MacBook with serial C02X91234567. They query the witnessing org, discover Peter sold it to Mary on January 14th. They can now trace the chain of custody backward to find the thief.

**Identity Disclosure:** With proper legal process (subpoena, warrant), the witnessing org releases Peter's verified identity to investigators.

**Insurance Companies**

**Claim Validation:** Verifying that a claimed item was actually purchased, at the stated price, on the stated date.

**Small Claims Courts**

**Evidence:** Verified transaction records serve as evidence in disputes over private sales.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Stranger Sale" Problem**

- **Fake Identity:** Seller uses a burner phone and fake name; buyer has no way to find them later.
- **Stolen Goods:** Item appears legitimate but is stolen; buyer becomes unwitting fence.
- **No Paper Trail:** Cash transactions leave no verifiable record of the exchange.
- **Platform Limitations:** Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist facilitate introductions but don't verify identities or witness transactions.

**How Witnessing Solves This**

The witnessing organization provides what a Starbucks meetup cannot:

1. **Identity Verification:** Both parties show government ID to a witness agent (in-person or via video verification app)
2. **Transaction Recording:** Item details, serial numbers, price, and condition are documented
3. **Hash-Verified Receipts:** Both parties receive a document they can verify against the witness's domain
4. **Contact Relay:** Parties can message each other through the witness without exchanging personal contact info
5. **Escalation Path:** Disputes can escalate to identity disclosure with proper process

**What the Witness is NOT:**

- **Not a payment processor** — Cash still changes hands directly
- **Not an escrow agent** — No funds are held
- **Not a money transmitter** — Avoids heavy financial regulation
- **Not a guarantor** — Doesn't insure the transaction

This is purely **identity escrow and transaction witnessing**—a notary for informal sales.

**One-Time vs. Recurring Identity Escrow:**

This is for one-time transactions. For ongoing service relationships (weekly cleaner, dog walker, babysitter), see `recurring-home-access-escrow.md`.

| Aspect              | One-Time (P2P Sale)                         | Recurring (Home Access)                      |
|:--------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| Duration            | Single transaction                          | Ongoing relationship                         |
| Escrow lifecycle    | Ends after sale                             | Duration + buffer period                     |
| Reputation          | None (one-off)                              | Accumulates over time                        |
| Disclosure triggers | Incident-based                              | Pattern-based alerts possible                |
| Key differentiator  | "Can I find them if this laptop is stolen?" | "Can I find them after 6 months of service?" |

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Personal

```
✓ witness.example-marketplace.com/verify — Witnesses peer-to-peer sales between individuals
```

No regulatory chain. Trust rests on the individual's domain.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer is the core of this use case — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the general mechanism. Here the witnessing firm goes further than hash custody: it verifies government-issued ID for both parties, records transaction details with timestamps, and retains identity information under strict access controls, disclosing it only via legal process or mutual consent. That gives both sides accountability (neither party can deny the transaction occurred), recourse (buyers can reach sellers after the fact), deterrence (sellers of stolen goods know their identity is on file), and evidence courts and police can rely on.

## Competition vs. Existing Solutions

| Feature | Witnessed P2P Sale | Facebook Marketplace | Pawn Shop | Cash in Parking Lot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity Verified** | **Yes.** Government ID. | **Partial.** Facebook profile. | **Yes.** Required by law. | **No.** |
| **Serial Recorded** | **Yes.** In witnessed record. | **No.** | **Yes.** Police database. | **No.** |
| **Post-Sale Contact** | **Yes.** Via relay. | **Maybe.** If account exists. | **Yes.** Store has records. | **No.** |
| **Price Received** | **Full market value.** | **Full market value.** | **30-50% of value.** | **Full market value.** |
| **Convenience** | **Medium.** Witness step. | **High.** | **Low.** Must go to shop. | **High.** |
| **Stolen Goods Check** | **Optional.** Serial lookup. | **No.** | **Yes.** Required by law. | **No.** |

**Why Witnessed P2P Sales Win:** Full market value (unlike pawn shops) plus identity verification and recourse (unlike parking lot deals). The small friction of a witness step provides significant protection for both parties.

## Implementation Models

**In-Person Witnessing:**
- Witness agents at retail locations (UPS Store, notary offices)
- Scheduled appointments at neutral locations
- Fee: $10-25 per transaction

**App-Based Witnessing:**
- Video call verification of IDs and item
- Both parties join a witnessed video session
- AI-assisted serial number capture
- Fee: $5-15 per transaction

**Hybrid:**
- App handles ID verification and documentation
- Public meetup for physical exchange
- Witness reviews and certifies afterward
