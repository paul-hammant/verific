## What is Temporary Insurance?

In the modern "Sharing Economy," **Temporary Insurance** (or On-Demand Insurance) covers a specific person for a short duration—ranging from 1 hour to 28 days. This is common when borrowing a friend's car, test-driving a vehicle, or driving for a gig-delivery app (like DoorDash). These policies are issued instantly via apps like Cuvva or Hugo.

These documents are "High-Velocity" proofs. Fraud is rampant in "Post-Accident" scenarios: a person crashes a car, then instantly buys a 1-hour policy on their phone and tries to "edit" the start-time on the PDF to 10 minutes *before* the crash. Verified hashes bind the **Precise Activation Timestamp (hh:mm:ss), Vehicle VIN, and Driver ID** to the insurer's domain (e.g., `cuvva.com` or `geico.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy ID, driver name, driver license number, vehicle VIN, vehicle license plate, precise start date/time (to the second), precise end date/time, liability limits, collision/comprehensive status, insurer name, premium paid, timestamp of purchase.

**Document Types:**
- **Temporary Insurance Binder:** The digital "Cover Note."
- **Gig-Platform Certificate:** For Uber/DoorDash "app-on" time.
- **Short-Term Travel Policy:** Covering a rented or borrowed vehicle.
- **Event-Specific Liability:** (Linked hash) for a one-day commercial use.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cuvva.com`, `hugosave.com`, `allstate.com`) and the coverage standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Verified** — The policy is current and the vehicle is protected *now*.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The coverage window (e.g., 3 hours) has passed.
- **Purchase Conflict** — **CRITICAL:** The policy was purchased AFTER the reported accident time.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Payment failed or policy was voided mid-term.

## Second-Party Use

The **Driver / Insured** benefits from verification.

**Borrowing Peace of Mind:** Before a driver takes the keys to their friend's $40,000 car, they buy a 3-hour policy and show the owner the verified hash. The owner can instantly see **"VERIFIED ACTIVE"** on their own phone, giving them the confidence to lend the vehicle without risking their own insurance premiums.

**Roadside Stop Speed:** If pulled over by police while driving a borrowed car, the driver shows the verified hash. The officer can instantly verify the **Time-Specific Coverage**, preventing an "Uninsured Vehicle" impoundment.

## Third-Party Use

**Vehicle Owners (Lenders)**
**Liability Shield:** Ensuring that a person borrowing their car actually has verified coverage that is primary to the owner's policy, protecting the owner's "Claims-Free" history.

**Police / Traffic Enforcement**
**Fraud Detection:** In a roadside stop, the officer scans the binder hash. Verification ensures the PDF start-time hasn't been "backed-up" by 10 minutes to hide an un-insured accident.

**Gig Platforms (Uber / Lyft)**
**Compliance Audit:** Automatically verifying that thousands of "Independent Contractors" have active, verified short-term policies for their specific shift times.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Post-Crash" Fraud Problem**

- **Timestamp Shifting:** Editing a 14:45 purchase time to 14:30 to cover a 14:35 accident.
- **VIN Swapping:** Using a policy for a "cheap car" to cover an accident in a "luxury car."
- **Payment Ghosting:** Showing a "Success" screen for a policy where the credit card was actually declined (verification reveals the "Cancelled" status).

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**App-Based Insurtechs.**
**Traditional Carriers (Digital Units).**
**Embedded Insurance Gateways.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Driver schedules and locations are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent data brokers from mapping the "Gig Workforce" density.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Temporary insurance providers and insurtech platforms issue short-term policies and are regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance and financial services framework.

```
✓ tempcover.co.uk/verify — Insurtech platform issuing temporary and short-term insurance policies
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Temporary insurance is the "Speed Limit of Fintech." By turning binders into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the owner's asset and the insurer's pool from the high-velocity risk of "Seconds-After-Impact" fraud.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive insurers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy ID, driver name, driver license number, vehicle VIN, vehicle license plate, precise start date/time, precise end date/time, liability limits, collision/comprehensive status, insurer name, premium paid, timestamp of purchase) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the temporary insurance binder.
