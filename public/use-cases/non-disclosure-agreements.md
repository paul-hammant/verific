## What is a Verified NDA?

A **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** is a foundational contract where parties agree not to share confidential information. In high-stakes business—such as tech demos, M&A due diligence, or celebrity employment—proving that an NDA was signed **before** secrets were revealed is the difference between a successful lawsuit and losing your IP forever.

A **Verified NDA** adds a cryptographic hash to the signature page. This proves:
1.  **Existence:** The specific version of the document existed on a specific date.
2.  **Integrity:** The "Scope of Confidentiality" terms haven't been altered since signing.
3.  **Identity:** The issuer (the law firm or the Disclosing Party) attests to the signature.

**"Page Swapping"** is a major risk in physical contracts. Disgruntled employees or rogue partners might swap a middle page of a physical NDA to remove a high-value technology from the "Confidential" list. Live Verify provides **Per-Page Verification**, ensuring that every paragraph of the contract remains exactly as it was when the digital hash was anchored to the legal domain.

## Data Verified

Party names, Effective date, Agreement ID, Page number (e.g., "Page 1 of 8"), Specific Scope of Confidentiality, Governing Law, Signature IDs, Law firm or Corporate Legal ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Mutual NDA:** Both sides share secrets.
- **One-Way NDA:** Used for investor pitches or vendor vetting.
- **Employee NDA:** Part of the onboarding/PIIA process.
- **Non-Compete Addendum:** (Linked hash) if allowed by local law.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Disclosing Party's Counsel or CLM Platform) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Agreement is currently in force and within its 5-year term.
- **Expired** — The confidentiality term has ended naturally.
- **Terminated** — **ALERT:** The agreement was voided early by mutual consent.
- **Amended** — Superseded by a newer contract (linked hash).

## Second-Party Use

The **Receiving Party (Vendor/Contractor)** benefits from verification.

**Compliance Clarity:** Proving to their own staff exactly *which* version of the NDA was signed. This prevents "Contract Creep" where the Disclosing Party tries to claim a stricter set of terms was in place than what was actually agreed upon.

**Audit Readiness:** Providing a verified list of active NDAs to an insurer or auditor to prove that the firm handles client trade secrets responsibly.

## Third-Party Use

**M&A Due Diligence Teams**
**IP Vetting:** When "Acquiring Corp" buys "Acme Corp," they need to verify that Acme actually has NDAs in place with all 500 of its former contractors. Live Verify allows for **Automated Due Diligence**, where an AI can scan thousands of NDAs and verify their status instantly against the legal domain.

**Courts and Arbitrators**
**Evidence Admissibility:** Proving that the NDA presented in a "Trade Secret Theft" case is the exact, un-altered original signed 3 years ago, reducing the "He-said-she-said" arguments over PDF versions.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Backdated Leak" Fraud Problem**

- **Backdating:** Signing an NDA *after* a leak happens and pretending it was signed before to avoid a lawsuit.
- **Page Substitution:** Replacing the "Scope" page in a physical contract to remove a specific technology from protection.
- **Status Faking:** Presenting an "Active" looking PDF for an NDA that was formally terminated months ago.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Law Firms:** (e.g., "verify:skadden.com/...").
**Corporate Legal Departments:** (e.g., "verify:google.legal/...").
**CLM Platforms:** (e.g., Ironclad, Icertis, LinkSquares - hosting the verified hashes).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Law firms and corporate legal departments issue NDA verifications certifying signed confidentiality agreements. The issuer is self-authorized as the legal custodian of the contract.

```
✓ legal.example-corp.com/nda/verify — Certifies non-disclosure agreements with scope and term
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (party names, effective date, agreement ID, confidentiality scope) — never secret information or confidential terms plaintext — providing non-repudiation of NDA issuance and status changes.


## Competition vs. E-Signature (DocuSign)

| Feature | Live Verify | E-Signature (Digital PKI) | Physical Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Survives being printed and scanned. | **Low.** Crypto signature is lost when printed. | **Manual.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Law Firm. | **System-Bound.** Trust the SaaS vendor. | **The Ink.** |
| **Self-Sovereign** | **High.** The paper is the proof. | **Low.** Requires the SaaS account to stay active. | **Total.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the *text*. | **High.** | **Zero.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "File Cabinet" reality. NDAs are often signed and then sit in a drawer or a shared drive for 10 years. SaaS vendors like DocuSign may go out of business or accounts may lapse. Live Verify ensures the contract remains **verifiable for its entire legal life**, regardless of whether the original software account is still active.
