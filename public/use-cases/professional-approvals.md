## What is a Professional Approval?

Some approvals can only be given by a qualified professional who attaches their name, their credential, and their personal liability to a specific work product. A structural engineer **stamps** a design as fit to build. An architect **approves** drawings for construction. A pharmacist or Qualified Person (QP) **releases** a drug batch for sale. An auditor **signs** a set of accounts. A surveyor **certifies** a building as complete. A radiologist **signs off** a scan report.

This is distinct from verifying that the person *holds* the credential — that is the [Appraiser](view.html?doc=appraiser-registration-status)/[Doctor](view.html?doc=gmc-doctor-registration-status)-style registration check. A professional approval is the **event**: a named, qualified professional took responsibility for *this deliverable*, on this date, within this scope. The fraud surface is the gap between a real professional's credential and the specific thing being claimed as approved.

Because the professional's liability rides on the document, these approvals are forged precisely to borrow that liability-backed trust: a builder who applies a real engineer's stamp to an unapproved revised drawing, a manufacturer who reuses a QP release across an unreleased batch, a developer who presents a forged completion certificate.

## The Approval Types

The same primitive recurs across the regulated professions:

- **Engineer's stamp / Engineer of Record sign-off** — A licensed engineer approves a design revision as fit to build. The contractor, building official, and insurer rely on it.
- **Architect's approval** — An architect approves drawings or shop-drawing submittals for construction.
- **Qualified Person (QP) batch release** — Under EU/UK GMP, a QP releases a pharmaceutical batch for market. Distributors and regulators rely on it.
- **Auditor's sign-off** — An audit partner signs an audit opinion on financial statements. Lenders, investors, and regulators rely on it. (See [Audit Reports and Financial Statements](view.html?doc=audit-reports-financial-statements).)
- **Surveyor / building-control completion** — A surveyor or building-control body approves a building as complete and compliant.
- **Clinical sign-off** — A radiologist, pathologist, or consultant signs off a report as their professional opinion.

In each, a named professional binds their credential and liability to a *specific* deliverable at a *specific* revision.

## The Approval Fraud Problem

- **Stamp lifting** — A real engineer's stamp/signature is copied from an approved drawing onto an unapproved later revision. The frame that gets built is not the frame that was approved.
- **Revision drift** — Approval was given for Rev. C; construction proceeds on an altered Rev. D that the professional never saw. Binding the revision into the hash makes the substitution visible.
- **Borrowed credentials** — A document carries a genuine professional's name and licence number, but that professional never approved this work (or has since withdrawn).
- **Batch reuse** — One genuine QP release is presented for product that was never in the released batch.
- **Withdrawn opinions** — A professional withdraws a sign-off (defect discovered, opinion qualified, retraction) but the original keeps circulating.

A verifiable approval ties the named professional's approval to the exact deliverable and revision, hosted at the professional's or firm's domain, with a live status that reflects withdrawal immediately.

## Data Verified

Professional's name and credential/licence, firm, the specific deliverable and its revision/identifier, the scope of what is approved (and excluded), the applicable code or standard, the date, any superseded revision, and a statement of the professional's certification.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., `vasquez-eng.com`) and the current status of the approval.

**Verification Response Format:**

```json
{
  "status": "verified",
  "allowedDomains": ["vasquez-eng.com", "*.vasquez-eng.com"]
}
```

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved — current** — The named professional approved this deliverable at this revision and the approval stands.
- **Superseded** — A later revision has been approved; this one is no longer the controlling approval.
- **Withdrawn** — The professional has withdrawn their approval (defect, error, retraction). Do not rely on it.
- **Conditional** — Approved subject to stated conditions; the response includes a summary.
- **404** — No such approval exists (never issued, stamp lifted onto unapproved work, or OCR error).

## Second-Party Use

The **professional or firm** benefits.

**Liability protection:** A verifiable approval that binds the exact revision proves precisely what the professional did and did not approve. When a stamp is lifted onto an altered drawing, the verification fails — protecting the professional from liability for work they never sanctioned. This mirrors the appraiser's defence: a verified record of *what they actually certified* is the strongest answer to "you approved this."

**Reputation:** A professional whose approvals are independently verifiable signals that their sign-offs cannot be quietly altered after the fact.

## Third-Party Use

**Building Officials and Regulators**

**Plan check / inspection:** A building official confirms the structural approval on site corresponds to the engineer's actual, current sign-off at the revision being built — catching revision drift before it is poured.

**Contractors and Sub-Contractors**

**Build-to-approved:** A contractor verifies they are building from an approved, current revision and not a superseded or unapproved set.

**Distributors and Pharmacies**

**Batch reliance:** A distributor verifies the QP release applies to the specific batch in hand before placing product on the market.

**Lenders, Investors, and Insurers**

**Reliance on opinions:** A lender relying on signed accounts, or an insurer underwriting a completed building, verifies the professional sign-off is genuine, current, and not withdrawn.

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- A professional's stamp/signature carries liability-backed trust, which makes it worth forging
- Approval is given for a specific revision, but the deliverable can be altered afterwards
- Recipients cannot tell a current approval from a superseded or withdrawn one
- A genuine credential can be borrowed for work the professional never approved

**The Fix:** The professional or firm issues a verifiable approval record at its domain, binding the named professional, the deliverable, and its exact revision. Recipients clip and verify before relying on or building from the approval.

**The reliance flow:**
1. The professional approves a specific deliverable at a specific revision
2. The firm publishes a verifiable approval record (hash) at its domain
3. A recipient (official, contractor, distributor, lender) clips the approval
4. Verification confirms the professional, the revision, the scope, and live status
5. If superseded or withdrawn → the recipient stops and obtains the current approval

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Professional approvals derive authority from the professional's licensure under a regulator, with the firm as issuer.

```
✓ vasquez-eng.com/approvals/v — Engineer of Record design approvals
  ✓ [state engineering board] — Licenses and disciplines professional engineers
```

For audit opinions the chain runs through the audit firm and its oversight body (e.g., PCAOB/FRC); for QP releases, through the manufacturing-authorisation holder and the medicines regulator (e.g., MHRA/EMA).

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the professional's or approving authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the professional approval.

## Further Derivations

1. **Revision-bound design approvals** — Each approved revision carries its own record, so a recipient can confirm they hold the controlling revision and detect a lifted stamp on a later, unapproved set.
2. **QP batch release verification** — Pharmaceutical batch releases verifiable by distributors and inspectors against the specific batch number, blunting release reuse.
3. **Co-signed / peer-reviewed sign-offs** — Approvals requiring a second qualified reviewer (e.g., independent design check, second-radiologist read), binding both professionals.
