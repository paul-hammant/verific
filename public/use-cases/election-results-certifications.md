## What are Election Result Certifications?

Election result certifications are the official documents that declare the outcome of an election. They include precinct-level tallies, county canvass reports, state certifications, and the final certified results that determine winners.

Election result fraud includes altering vote counts, fabricating precinct reports, and misrepresenting certified outcomes. Verified result documents create an immutable audit trail from precinct to final certification.

## Data Verified

Election date and type, jurisdiction, office/contest, candidate names, vote counts, total ballots, turnout percentage, certification date, certifying officials, any recount/audit notes.

**Document Types:**
- **Precinct Results:** Initial count from individual polling places.
- **Absentee/Mail Ballot Tally:** Separate count of mail-in votes.
- **Provisional Ballot Report:** Adjudicated provisional ballots.
- **County Canvass:** Aggregated county results certified by board.
- **State Certification:** Final state-level certified results.
- **Recount Report:** Results after official recount.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`elections.maricopa.gov`, `azsos.gov`) and result status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Unofficial** — Preliminary results, not yet certified.
- **Certified** — Officially certified by appropriate authority.
- **Under Recount** — Recount in progress.
- **Amended** — Corrected after error discovery.
- **Contested** — Legal challenge pending.
- **Final** — All challenges resolved, result is permanent.

## Second-Party Use

The **Candidates / Campaigns** benefit from verification.

**Result Confirmation:** Candidates can verify that official results match what was publicly announced.

**Legal Proceedings:** In election contests, verified result documents provide authenticated evidence.

**Historical Record:** Winners can prove their certified election results for biographical purposes.

## Third-Party Use

**Media / Journalists**
**Result Verification:** News organizations can verify that numbers they're reporting match official certified results.

**Courts**
**Election Contests:** Verified result documents serve as authenticated evidence in election lawsuits.

**Academic Researchers**
**Election Studies:** Political scientists can verify historical election data for research.

**International Observers**
**Election Monitoring:** Foreign election observers can independently verify results against official certifications.

**Opposing Campaigns**
**Audit Trail:** Losing candidates can verify the chain of results from precinct to state certification.

## Verification Architecture

**The Election Result Fraud Problem**

- **Count Manipulation:** Altering vote totals in result reports.
- **Precinct Fabrication:** Creating fake precinct-level results.
- **Certification Forgery:** Fake certification documents claiming different winners.
- **Historical Revisionism:** Altering archived results after the fact.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Precinct Officials:** Initial precinct-level results.
**County Election Boards:** County canvass and certification.
**State Secretaries of State:** State-level certification.
**Federal Agencies:** (FEC, EAC) federal election data.

**Chain of Results**

Results flow upward: Precinct → County → State → Federal. Each level's certification should reference the hashes of the lower-level documents it aggregates, creating a verifiable chain.

**Public Transparency**

Unlike many use cases, election results are inherently public. Verification doesn't protect privacy - it ensures that public results haven't been altered after publication.

**Recount Integration**

When recounts occur, the recount report should reference the original certified result hash and explain any changes, creating an auditable correction trail.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Electoral commissions and boards hold statutory authority under election law to certify election results and canvass reports.

```
✓ electoralcommission.org.uk/verify — Certifies election results and canvass documents
```

Self-authorized — this is a sovereign body whose authority derives from statute.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the election authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (election date, jurisdiction, office, candidate names, vote counts, total ballots, certification date, certifying officials) — never plaintext voter information — providing non-repudiation of the election results certification.
