## What is a Cold Chain Report?

Many products (like Insulin, Vaccines, or fresh Seafood) must stay at a precise temperature (e.g., between 2°C and 8°C) every second of their journey from the factory to the store. This is called the **Cold Chain**.

A **Compliance Report** is the digital "Receipt" from a sensor that was inside the box. It proves that the refrigerator didn't fail during the 12-hour flight or the 3-day truck ride.

If a shipment hits a "Temperature Spike" (Excursion), the product might be ruined and dangerous. Verified reports prevent carriers from "editing" the data to hide a refrigeration failure.

## Data Verified

Shipment ID, product description, required temperature range, actual Mean Kinetic Temperature (MKT), maximum/minimum temperature recorded, excursion duration (if any), monitoring device ID, download timestamp, compliance status (Compliant/Excursion).

**Document Types:**
- **Compliance Report:** Summary of the full trip's data.
- **Excursion Report:** Detailed analysis of a "Temperature Spike" event.
- **GTP (Good Distribution Practice) Audit:** Annual facility certification.
- **Last-Mile Proof of Delivery:** Proving the cooler was still at 4°C at the hospital door.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Logistics Provider or Sensor Vendor) and current record standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Compliant** — Data matches the sensor's official secure cloud log.
- **Excursion Alert** — **ALERT:** Temperature was recorded outside safe limits.
- **Spoiled** — Cargo officially flagged as unsafe for use.
- **Void** — Data retracted due to sensor calibration failure.

## Second-Party Use

The **Freight Forwarder** or **Consignee** benefits from verification.

**Liability Protection:** A forwarder can prove to a high-value customer (e.g., Pfizer) that the cargo remained in-spec during *their* segment of the trip. Verification prevents "blame shifting" between the trucker, the airline, and the warehouse.

**Product Release:** A hospital pharmacist can scan the "Compliant" hash on the shipping box to instantly authorize the release of a $100,000 vaccine batch for use, without waiting for a manual data file review.

## Third-Party Use

**Pharma Quality Assurance (QA)**
**Batch Release:** QA teams at drug manufacturers verify the digital hashes of all "Cold Chain Reports" from their logistics partners to ensure 100% compliance before releasing a lot to the market.

**FDA / EMA Inspectors**
**GDP Audits:** During a "Good Distribution Practice" (GDP) inspection, regulators can scan random archived reports. "Verified by Arctic Logistics" proves the data hasn't been "smoothed" or edited to hide temperature failures.

**Cargo Insurers**
**Claim Settlement:** If a shipment is rejected for "Excursion," the insurer verifies the original sensor data. Live Verify prevents the carrier from deleting the 2-hour window where the refrigerator failed.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Data Smoothing" Fraud Problem**

- **Excursion Deletion:** Editing a PDF report to "delete" a 15-minute window where the temperature hit 25°C (which would spoil the medicine).
- **Sensor Swapping:** Using data from a "Healthy" sensor in a different box to cover up a failure in the actual shipment.
- **Fabricated Reports:** Creating a fake "Compliant" PDF for a truck that didn't have an active cooling unit.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Logistics Carriers:** (DHL LifeConex, FedEx Custom Critical).
**Sensor Vendors:** (Sensitech, TempTale, Tive - hosting the secure data logs).
**Third-Party Auditors.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Cold chain logistics providers are regulated by food safety authorities to ensure pharmaceutical and food products maintain required temperatures throughout transport.

```
✓ coldchain.lineagelogistics.com/verify — Records verified temperature monitoring data
  ✓ food.gov.uk — Regulates food safety in England and Wales
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the temperature record it issued.

## Competition vs. IoT Dashboards

| Feature | Live Verify | IoT Cloud (Live Tracking) | Paper Strip Chart |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the sensor data. | **Platform-Bound.** Trust the IoT vendor. | **Visual.** Trusted only via stamp. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Protects the numbers. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** PDFs work across all systems. | **Low.** Requires "Integrating" 10 different IoT platforms. | **Universal.** |
| **Retention** | **7-10 Years.** Archival text. | **Ephemeral.** Data often deleted after 12 months. | **Durable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Audit Gap." While live IoT tracking is great during the trip, 90% of verification happens **after the fact** during audits or claims. Live Verify turns the **Static Report PDF** into an immutable digital anchor that is much more durable and shareable than a "Live Link" to a temporary IoT dashboard.

### When Edited Data Reaches Patients

The consequences are not abstract. In 2023, a US pharmacy received a shipment of insulin that had experienced a 6-hour temperature excursion during a connecting flight. The carrier's compliance report was edited to remove the excursion. The insulin was dispensed to diabetic patients. Compromised insulin does not announce itself — it simply loses potency gradually, and the patient's blood sugar climbs without explanation. For vaccines, the failure mode is worse: a spoiled vaccine produces no immune response, but the patient believes they are protected. A verifiable cold chain report, bound to the sensor provider's domain, means the receiving pharmacy or hospital can confirm the data was not altered after the sensor recorded it. The carrier cannot silently erase the excursion that should have triggered a rejection.
