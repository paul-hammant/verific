## What is Aircraft Parts Traceability?

Every critical component on a commercial aircraft has a documented life history — where it was made, who certified it, which aircraft it's been installed on, how many flight cycles it's consumed, and whether it's been repaired, overhauled, or scrapped. This history lives in paper: the FAA **Form 8130-3** (Authorized Release Certificate) in the US, the EASA **Form 1** in Europe, and equivalent documents in every aviation jurisdiction. The paperwork follows the part through its entire life.

The problem: the paperwork is trivially forged. An 8130-3 is a single-page form. Templates circulate online. A counterfeiter manufacturing turbine blades from substandard alloy in a Shenzhen workshop can produce an 8130-3 that's indistinguishable from a genuine one. The part enters the supply chain through a broker, passes through one or two intermediaries, and arrives at an MRO (Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul) facility with paperwork that looks perfect. The FAA calls these **Suspected Unapproved Parts (SUPs)** and estimates they account for up to 2% of installed components. In a fleet of 25,000 commercial aircraft, each with millions of parts, 2% is a terrifying number.

A **Verifiable Part Marking** is a laser-etched verification line on the physical component itself — not on the paperwork that accompanies it, but on the metal. The manufacturer etches the part number, serial number, and a verification domain during production. Anyone with a camera — an MRO engineer, an airline inspector, a regulator — scans the marking and gets a live response from the manufacturer's domain: what the part is, where it should be right now, and whether it's airworthy.

## The Duplicate Detection Problem

The etching on the part is plain text. A forger who has physical access to a genuine part can photograph the etching and reproduce it on a counterfeit. Both parts now carry identical markings. Both scan as valid.

The system catches this through **installation status**. A part can only be in one place at a time. The manufacturer's database records where each serial number currently lives — which airframe, which MRO, which warehouse. When a second scan comes from an unexpected location, the response changes from "Serviceable — Installed on G-XLEA" to "Location Conflict — Investigate."

The arbitration is straightforward: the genuine part has a documented chain of custody (manufacture → test → release certificate → sale → installation log → aircraft technical record). The counterfeit's chain has a gap or a fabrication. The aviation authority for each aircraft's registry state — the FAA, EASA, CAA, or equivalent — has jurisdiction and makes the airworthiness determination.

This doesn't require the system to know which is genuine at the moment of scanning. It requires the system to flag that **two parts claim to be the same part**, and that one of them is lying. The investigation follows.

## Data Verified

Manufacturer name, part number, serial number, manufacture date, verification domain. The etching is minimal — identity only. The rich data (installation history, cycle counts, overhaul records, airworthiness directives) lives in the verification response, not on the part.

**Document Types (accompanying paperwork, separately verifiable):**
- **FAA Form 8130-3 (Authorized Release Certificate):** The US release document. Issued by the manufacturer or an FAA-approved repair station when a part is manufactured, repaired, or overhauled. The form that's most commonly forged.
- **EASA Form 1 (Authorized Release Certificate):** The European equivalent.
- **CAA Form CAA 386 (UK):** Post-Brexit UK equivalent.
- **Airworthiness Directive Compliance Record:** Proof that mandatory modifications or inspections have been carried out.
- **Life-Limited Parts Record:** Tracking cycles, hours, and calendar time against the manufacturer's life limit.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the manufacturer's domain (`rolls-royce.com`, `ge.com/aviation`, `safrangroup.com`) and the part's current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Serviceable — Installed** — Part is currently installed on a specific airframe (identified by registration and Mode S hex code). Includes cycles/hours consumed against life limits.
- **Serviceable — In Storage** — Part is in a bonded warehouse or airline inventory. Location recorded.
- **Serviceable — In MRO** — Part is undergoing maintenance, repair, or overhaul at a named facility.
- **Unserviceable — Awaiting Repair** — Part has been removed and requires work before reinstallation.
- **Scrapped — Do Not Install** — Part has been permanently retired (life limit reached, unrepairable damage, superseded by airworthiness directive). Installation of a scrapped part is a criminal offence.
- **Life Limit Approaching** — Part has consumed >80% of its certified life. Remaining cycles/hours shown.
- **Location Conflict — Investigate** — **CRITICAL:** A part with this serial number is recorded as being elsewhere. Possible counterfeit. Contact manufacturer and aviation authority.
- **Not Found** — No part with this serial number exists in the manufacturer's records. **Do not install.** Possible counterfeit.
- **Stolen / Missing** — Part reported missing from an MRO, warehouse, or incident site. Contact law enforcement.

## Second-Party Use

The **Airline / Operator** benefits from verification.

**Incoming parts inspection:** An airline receives a shipment of turbine blades from a broker. Before accepting them into inventory, the receiving inspector scans each part. The manufacturer's domain confirms each serial is genuine, serviceable, and not recorded as installed elsewhere. Three scans, three green responses, parts accepted. One "Not Found" or "Scrapped" — the entire shipment is quarantined and the broker investigated.

**MRO shop visit:** An engine comes in for overhaul. The MRO strips it down and scans every life-limited part. The verification responses show remaining cycle life, outstanding airworthiness directives, and whether any part has been flagged. This supplements (but doesn't replace) the paper records that accompanied the engine.

**Fleet audit:** An airline conducts a periodic audit of its parts inventory. Scanning barcoded stock against the manufacturer's verification endpoints confirms nothing has been misrecorded, lost, or substituted.

## Third-Party Use

**Aviation Authorities (FAA, EASA, CAA)**
**Airworthiness Oversight:** When an authority issues an Airworthiness Directive (mandatory inspection or modification of a specific part), verification endpoints let them confirm compliance. Is part S/N ESN-884721 still installed on G-XLEA? Has the AD been complied with? The manufacturer's response includes AD compliance status — no need to wait for the airline to self-report.

**Accident Investigators (AAIB, NTSB, BEA)**
**Wreckage Identification:** After an accident, investigators recover components from wreckage. Scanning the etching on a recovered turbine blade confirms which engine it came from, when it was last overhauled, how many cycles it had consumed, and whether it was a genuine part. If the etching returns "Not Found" — the investigation immediately pivots to the parts supply chain.

**Parts Brokers & Distributors**
**Inventory Authentication:** Legitimate brokers (like HEICO, AAR Corp, Aviall) can verify parts they're buying from other brokers. The secondary market for aircraft parts is worth $50+ billion annually, and the long supply chains between original manufacturer and end user are where counterfeits enter. A broker scanning a part and seeing "Scrapped" or "Location Conflict" before purchasing it prevents the counterfeit from advancing further.

**Insurance Underwriters (Aviation)**
**Hull Loss & Liability:** After a hull loss or in-flight incident, the insurer's investigators check whether installed parts were genuine and properly maintained. A counterfeit part found during the investigation is grounds for denying the claim and pursuing the parts supplier.

**Lessors**
**Transition Inspections:** When an aircraft transfers between operators (lease return, sale), the receiving operator inspects every component. Verified part markings give the lessor and lessee a shared, auditable record that every installed part is genuine, serviceable, and correctly documented. Lease agreements increasingly require full parts traceability — verification against the OEM's domain is the highest standard.

**Customs Authorities**
**Import Screening:** Aircraft parts entering a country through customs can be spot-checked by scanning the etching. "Not Found" on a crate of turbine blades from an unfamiliar exporter triggers seizure and investigation. This is particularly relevant for parts transiting through jurisdictions with weak regulatory oversight.

## Verification Architecture

**The Counterfeit Parts Problem**

The FAA's SUP (Suspected Unapproved Parts) programme has identified thousands of counterfeit, substandard, or improperly documented parts in the supply chain. The economics drive the fraud:

- **A new CFM56 high-pressure turbine blade costs $5,000-$15,000.** A counterfeit manufactured from non-certified alloy costs a fraction. The profit margin on a single fraudulent blade justifies the risk for criminal enterprises.
- **Supply chains are long and opaque.** A part manufactured by Rolls-Royce in Derby might be sold to an airline in Singapore, removed during overhaul, sold to a broker in Miami, resold to a broker in Dubai, and installed on an aircraft in Kenya. Each intermediary adds a layer of paperwork. Each layer is an opportunity for a counterfeit to enter.
- **Paper is the weakest link.** The 8130-3 form is the aviation industry's trust anchor — and it's a single page with no anti-forgery features. A colour printer produces one that's indistinguishable from genuine. The form carries a signature, but nobody verifies signatures across jurisdictions. A "John Smith, FAA Designee" signature on a form from a repair station in Southeast Asia is accepted at face value.
- **Scrapped parts re-entering service.** When a life-expired part is scrapped, it's supposed to be physically mutilated (cut, crushed, drilled). But some scrap dealers sell "as removed" parts with new paperwork claiming they've been overhauled. The part looks fine externally — the metallurgical fatigue that makes it dangerous is invisible without laboratory testing.

**The "Naughty Middleman" Problem**

Not all parts fraud involves counterfeit manufacturing. Some involves legitimate parts with fraudulent documentation:

- **Over-age parts:** A broker has parts with 18,000 of 20,000 cycles consumed. They're worth almost nothing because no airline wants a part with 10% life remaining. The broker falsifies the cycle count on the paperwork — now it reads 8,000 cycles and the part is worth $10,000.
- **Unapproved repairs:** A repair station without the proper FAA/EASA approval performs maintenance on a component and issues paperwork as though they were approved. The work may be competent or incompetent — either way, it's not traceable to a certified process.
- **Airline cost-cutting:** Airlines under financial pressure may accept parts from dubious sources because they're cheaper than OEM supply. The airline's own procurement team knows the parts are questionable but looks the other way because the quarterly numbers need to work. This isn't hypothetical — it's been documented in enforcement actions.
- **Pooling fraud:** Airlines participate in parts-sharing pools. A pool member swaps a worn part for a fresh one, claiming equal value. The verification response showing 18,000 cycles on the returned part vs. 2,000 on the replacement catches the mismatch.

**Laser Etching Specifications**

The verification prefix uses `vfy:` rather than the standard `verify:` — saving 4 characters of laser etching on surfaces where every millimetre matters. The app recognises both prefixes; the short form exists for physical markings where surface area is constrained.

The marking must survive the operating environment without specialised reading equipment:

- **Character height:** 1.5-2mm for human-readable text, suitable for phone camera or maintenance tablet at 10-30cm distance. Data matrix codes (already standard in aerospace per SAE AS9132) can be smaller but require machine readers.
- **Marking method:** Laser annealing for non-material-removing marks on titanium and nickel alloys. Laser engraving for aluminium and steel. Both are already standard processes under SAE AMS2431 and MIL-STD-130.
- **Surface location:** External surfaces accessible during line maintenance (no disassembly required). Internal surfaces accessible during shop visits. Location standardised per component type by the OEM.
- **Durability:** The marking must survive the part's operating envelope (temperature, vibration, hydraulic fluid, cleaning chemicals). Existing aerospace laser markings already meet this standard — the verification text uses the same marking process, just with different content.

**Why Not QR Codes?**

For paper documents, the "why not QR?" question is about visual clutter and human readability. For parts etched into metal operating inside a jet engine, it's simpler: **QR codes can't survive the environment.** A QR code depends on precise geometry — clean squares at exact positions. Thermal cycling between -50°C and 1,000°C+, vibration, erosion from fuel and hydraulic fluid, and decades of service degrade fine geometric detail. A QR code that loses a few squares becomes unreadable. Human-readable text etched into metal degrades gracefully — a partially worn character is still recognisable to OCR (and to a human eye). The verification text uses the format that the operating environment permits: plain text, laser-etched, at a scale (1.5-2mm characters) that survives where geometry-dependent codes cannot.

**Why Not a Portal Lookup?**

Today, checking a part's status means reading the serial number off the component, walking to a terminal, logging into the manufacturer's parts traceability portal (each OEM has their own), typing the serial number, and interpreting the result. This requires portal credentials, manufacturer-specific systems, and connectivity to that manufacturer's network. Many MRO facilities maintain login credentials for a dozen different OEM portals.

The verified etching replaces this with the same pattern as every other Live Verify use case: point phone at part, capture text, get response. No portal login, no typing serial numbers, no manufacturer-specific application. The MRO engineer uses the same verification app for a Rolls-Royce turbine blade, a Safran landing gear actuator, and a Collins avionics module — the domain in the verification response tells them which manufacturer is attesting. The portal still exists for detailed engineering queries, but the binary question — "is this part genuine, serviceable, and where it should be?" — is answered by a camera scan in three seconds.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs):**
- **Rolls-Royce** (`rolls-royce.com`) — Engines, turbine blades, rotating parts
- **GE Aviation** (`ge.com/aviation`) — Engines, components
- **Safran** (`safrangroup.com`) — Landing gear (Safran Landing Systems), engine components (Safran Aircraft Engines), nacelles
- **Collins Aerospace / RTX** (`collinsaerospace.com`) — Avionics, actuation, environmental control
- **Honeywell Aerospace** (`aerospace.honeywell.com`) — APUs, avionics, wheels and brakes

**Airframe Manufacturers:**
- **Airbus** (`airbus.com`) — Structural components, proprietary parts
- **Boeing** (`boeing.com`) — Structural components, proprietary parts

**Approved Repair Stations:** FAA Part 145 / EASA Part 145 approved MROs that overhaul components and issue release certificates. Their domain verifies the overhaul, the OEM's domain verifies the original part — two verification layers.

## Beyond Aviation: Other Safety-Critical Parts

The same pattern applies wherever expensive, safety-critical components attract counterfeiters, fraudulent intermediaries, or cost-cutting operators:

**Marine — Ship Engines & Propulsion**

Large marine diesel engines (MAN, Wärtsilä, Caterpillar) have components worth tens of thousands of dollars. Counterfeit piston rings, cylinder liners, and fuel injectors enter the marine supply chain through port-city brokers in Singapore, Rotterdam, and Fujairah. A container ship's engine failure in a busy shipping lane creates environmental and safety catastrophe. The same etching-and-verification pattern works: the part is marked during manufacture, the response shows which vessel (by IMO number — the maritime equivalent of Mode S) it should be installed on.

**Rail — Bogies, Wheels, and Axles**

A train wheelset costs £10,000-£30,000 and has a defined life measured in kilometres. Counterfeit or over-life wheelsets on high-speed rail are catastrophic — the Eschede disaster in Germany (1998, 101 dead) was caused by a wheel failure. Wheel manufacturers (Lucchini, Bochumer Verein, Amsted Rail) etch serial numbers already; adding a verification domain lets any maintenance depot confirm the wheel's life consumption and service history against the manufacturer's records. The verification response: "On unit 390045, bogie A, position 2. 1.2M of 2.5M km consumed."

**Nuclear — Reactor Components**

Nuclear-grade valves, pipe fittings, and fasteners are manufactured to extreme specifications (ASME Section III, Class 1). Counterfeit nuclear parts have been detected in US plants — the NRC issued Information Notice 2014-16 on the subject. A counterfeit valve in a reactor coolant system could fail under conditions where failure is not permitted. Nuclear parts already carry extensive quality documentation; adding manufacturer-domain verification to the physical part marking creates a tamper-evident link between the component and its quality record. Nuclear operators (EDF, Exelon, TEPCO) would verify during incoming inspection, installation, and periodic in-service inspection.

**Medical Devices — Implantable Components**

Hip joints, knee replacements, spinal fusion hardware, cardiac stents, and pacemaker leads. Medical device counterfeiting is a growing problem, particularly in markets where devices are resold or reprocessed. A surgeon implanting a hip joint from a third-party distributor scans the laser etching on the component. The verification response from `smith-nephew.com` or `stryker.com` confirms: genuine part, correct batch, not recalled, not a reprocessed single-use device. Post-implantation, the verification record links the specific serial to the specific patient — critical for recall scenarios where the manufacturer needs to identify every patient with a particular batch of devices.

**Oil & Gas — Wellhead and BOP Components**

Blowout preventer (BOP) components, wellhead valves, and subsea connectors operate under extreme pressure. The Deepwater Horizon disaster (2010) focused attention on BOP reliability. Counterfeit flanges and fittings have been found in oil and gas supply chains — the American Petroleum Institute (API) runs a counterfeit parts programme. API-monogrammed products could carry manufacturer-domain verification: scan the flange, `cameron.slb.com` confirms it's genuine and rated for the pressure class claimed.

**Wind Turbine — Gearbox & Main Bearing**

A wind turbine main bearing costs £100,000-£250,000 and is expected to last 20-25 years. Premature failure requires a crane (£50,000-£100,000 per mobilisation) and weeks of downtime. Counterfeit or substandard bearings from grey-market suppliers have entered the wind industry supply chain. Manufacturer verification from `skf.com` or `timken.com` confirms the bearing's specification, manufacture date, and intended application — catching substandard substitutions before installation at the top of an 80-metre tower.

**Defence — Controlled Components**

Military aircraft, naval vessels, and ground vehicles face the same counterfeit parts problem as commercial aviation, compounded by ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) and EAR (Export Administration Regulations) compliance. A verified part marking on a defence component confirms not just authenticity but authorised chain of custody — the part hasn't transited through embargoed jurisdictions or been diverted from an authorised end-user.

**Civilian and civic markings.** The same etched-`vfy:`-line pattern extends beyond safety-critical industrial parts to everyday durable markings — machinery rating plates, VINs, firearm serials, jewellery hallmarks, monuments and provenance plaques. Those are written up as a sibling family in [Durable Marked Identifiers](durable-marked-identifiers.md); this page carries the full laser-etching specifications they reuse.

## Rationale

Aircraft parts traceability is the highest-stakes verification use case in this collection. A forged DBS certificate can ruin a career; a forged prescription can harm a patient; a forged aircraft part can kill 300 people. The paper-based system (Form 8130-3 / EASA Form 1) was designed for an era when supply chains were short and trust relationships were direct. The modern supply chain — with parts crossing multiple brokers, jurisdictions, and MRO facilities before reaching an aircraft — has outgrown paper. The part itself is the one constant: it's there at manufacture, there at every inspection, there at installation, and there if things go wrong. Making the part its own verification document — through a laser etching that any camera can read and any phone can check against the manufacturer's domain — puts the trust anchor on the thing that matters, not on the paper that accompanies it.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the manufacturer or authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (part number, serial, certification) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.
