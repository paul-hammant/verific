## What is a Pest Inspection Certificate?

In the real estate world, the **Wood Destroying Insect (WDI)** report (commonly called a "Termite Certificate") is a critical closing document. It is a formal certification by a licensed inspector stating whether a house has active infestations or past structural damage from termites, carpenter ants, or beetles.

Because a "Positive" finding can kill a home sale or require a $5,000 treatment, these reports are primary targets for fraud. Sellers often "edit" a report to turn "Active Infestation" into "None Found," or they "delete" a section that mentions $10,000 in hidden structural damage. Verified hashes bind the **Property Address, Inspection Findings, and Inspector's License** to the inspection firm's or the state board's domain (e.g., `orkin.com` or `pest-registry.gov`).

## Data Verified

Report ID, property address, owner name (optional/masked), buyer name, inspection date, active infestation status (Yes/No), previous damage location/severity, treatment recommendations, inspector name/license, company name, date of signature.

**Document Types:**
- **WDI Inspection Report:** (Form NPMA-33) The industry standard.
- **Treatment Certificate:** Proof that a house was recently "Tented" or treated.
- **Termite Bond:** (Linked hash) the ongoing maintenance guarantee.
- **Wood Infestation Letter:** A simplified summary for some lenders.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`orkin.com`, `terminix.com`, `state-ag-board.gov`) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Clear** — Report matches the original digital record; no active bugs.
- **Treatment Required** — **ALERT:** The original report recommended immediate chemical treatment.
- **Damage Flagged** — **ALERT:** Structural issues were identified that require a contractor audit.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Report is more than 30 days old; re-inspection required for closing.

## Second-Party Use

The **Home Seller / Real Estate Agent** benefits from verification.

**Closing Speed:** Before a bank releases a $500,000 mortgage, the underwriter scans the seller's WDI hash. "Verified by Orkin" ensures the bank that the house isn't "Bug Infested," removing the 3-day "Manual Report Vetting" delay and allowing the deal to close on schedule.

**Disclosure Shield:** A seller can use the verified hash to prove exactly what they disclosed to the buyer at the time of sale, defending against a "Hidden Damage" lawsuit filed 2 years later.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Underwriters**
**Collateral Risk Audit:** Thousands of "Edited" PDF reports are submitted to banks every month. Live Verify connects the underwriter directly to the inspection firm's domain, stopping "Termite Fraud" at the source and protecting the bank's property lien.

**Home Buyers (The Public)**
**Due Diligence:** A potential buyer can scan the WDI hash provided in the "Listing Packet" before they even make an offer. This ensures the "Clean" report isn't a fabrication, protecting them from buying a "Money Pit" with structural rot.

**Title and Escrow Companies**
**Closing Audit:** Verifying that the WDI report in the file is the final, un-altered version required by the lender's instructions.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Finding Scrubbing" Fraud Problem**

- **Infestation Masking:** Changing an "Active" checkbox to "None" on a PDF to hide a termite problem.
- **Damage Deletion:** Removing a page of the report that shows a photo of a rotted sill plate.
- **License Mimicry:** Creating a fake report using a reputable inspector's name and license number from a public board.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Pest Control Firms.**
**Independent Licensed Inspectors.**
**State Departments of Agriculture (Licensing Boards).**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Specific property defect details and home addresses are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Neighborhood Blight Mapping" by data brokers or speculators.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Pest control firms and inspectors are accredited to issue pest infestation certificates.

```
✓ report.example-pest.com — Issues pest inspection reports
  ✓ bpca.org.uk — Accredits UK pest management professionals
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Pest inspection is the "Structural Integrity" audit of a home. By turning static reports into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the buyer's investment and the lender's collateral, ensuring that "Clear" really means "No Bugs."

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the inspection firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (Report ID, property address, inspection date, inspector name/license) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the pest inspection report and an audit trail regulators can inspect.
