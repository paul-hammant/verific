## Data Verified

Insured name, FIPS county code, specific crop types/livestock categories, total acreage/head count, coverage level % (e.g., 85%), total policy liability, effective/expiration dates, underwriter ID, RMA plan code (e.g., RP - Revenue Protection).

**Document Types:**
- **Summary of Coverage:** The primary multi-million dollar asset proof.
- **Livestock Risk Protection (LRP) Certificate:** For price-floor protection.
- **Acreage Report:** (Linked hash) proving exactly what was planted.
- **Actual Production History (APH) Report:** Verified 5-year yield data.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`naucountry.com`, `fmh.com`, `rainhail.com`) and current policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; crops/herd are verified covered.
- **Adjusted** — Field report finalized; limits locked.
- **Claim Pending** — Notice of loss filed (e.g., for drought).
- **Lapsed/Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Policy not current; rural bank collateral is unprotected.

## Second-Party Use

The **Farmer (Producer)** benefits from verification.

**Operating Loans:** Proving to an ag-lender (e.g., Rabobank or Farm Credit) that the $1.2M in "Revenue Liability" is verified. This allows the farmer to use the insurance as collateral for high-value loans to buy fertilizer and feed.

**Landlord Assurance:** Proving to a major landowner that their share of the "Crop Share" lease is verified protected against natural disasters.

## Third-Party Use

**Ag-Lenders (Banks)**
**Collateral Protection:** Banks require crop insurance to protect their loans against weather risk. Verification ensures the farmer hasn't "Edited" the paper summary to show 85% coverage when they only paid for 50%.

**USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA)**
**Compliance Audit:** Ensuring that private insurance companies (AIPs) are issuing policies that match the federal government's data standards.

**Grain Elevators**
**Forward Contracts:** Verifying that a farmer has the revenue protection insurance to back up a forward-delivery contract for 100,000 bushels.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Acre" Fraud Problem**

- **Acreage Padding:** Claiming to have 1,200 insured acres on the paper summary shown to the bank, while only paying for 500 acres at the insurance company.
- **Status Faking:** Showing an old "Active" paper for a policy that was cancelled for non-payment mid-season.
- **Entity Fraud:** Using a shell company name to bypass federal subsidy limits while using a verified looking PDF to get a loan.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs):** (NAU Country, Rain & Hail, FMH).
**USDA Risk Management Agency.**
**Ag-Fintech Platforms:** (e.g., Indigo, Farmers Business Network - hosting the hashes).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

NFU Mutual, a regulated agricultural insurer, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified livestock and crop insurance policies.

```
✓ livestock.nfu-mutual.co.uk/verify — Issues verified livestock and crop insurance policies
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurance provider's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, coverage type, acreage, coverage level, effective dates) — never farm location, farmer identity, or production history — providing non-repudiation of the insurance policy and an audit trail USDA administrators can inspect.


## Competition vs. USDA Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | USDA / RMA Public Search | Scanned PDF Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Open.** Any bank or landlord can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires secure eAuth Level 2 logins. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Detail** | **High.** Shows specific fields and head count. | **Low.** Often only shows aggregated county data. | **Full.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan at the farm gate. | **Slow.** Requires multiple Gov-ID hoops. | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Ag-Banking" reality. Local bank officers and farmers often work via paper folders and email. They don't have the technical "Federal Vetting" or time to log into the USDA's internal systems for every $50,000 loan. Live Verify turns the **Insurance Summary** into a live, high-speed trust bridge, allowing rural finance to move at the speed of the web.
