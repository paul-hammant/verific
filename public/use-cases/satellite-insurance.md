## What is Satellite Insurance?

In the commercial space industry, **Satellite Insurance** covers some of the highest-value risks on Earth (and above it). A single policy covers the **Launch Phase** (the risk of the rocket exploding) and the **In-Orbit Phase** (the risk of the satellite failing once in space). These policies typically cover assets worth $200M to $500M each.

These documents are the "Proof of Mission." Fraud is extremely rare but high-impact: a startup might create a fake "Allianz" or "Swiss Re" policy to trick a launch provider (like SpaceX) or a telecommunications partner into believing the mission is fully bonded. Similarly, an operator might "edit" a policy to hide a "Collision Exclusion" before a high-risk orbital maneuver. Verified hashes bind the **Satellite ID (COSPAR), Launch Window, and In-Orbit Value** to the specialist insurer's domain (e.g., `axaxl.com` or `beazley.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, insurer name, operator name, satellite name/serial, COSPAR ID (if assigned), launch vehicle type, launch site location, launch window dates, in-orbit insured value, third-party liability (TPL) limit, policy term (years), exclusion codes (e.g., Solar Storms), broker ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Evidence of Space Insurance:** Provided to launch providers.
- **Launch Phase Summary:** Covering the "Intent to Launch" risk.
- **In-Orbit Liability Certificate:** Required for international space law.
- **Proof of Re-Entry Coverage:** For decommissioning safety.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`axaxl.com`, `beazley.com`, `swissre.com`) and the policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Launch Authorized** — Premium is paid; mission is covered.
- **In-Orbit Operational** — Launch successful; long-term coverage active.
- **Claim Filed** — **ALERT:** A mission anomaly or failure has been reported.
- **Expired / De-Orbit** — **ALERT:** Asset has reached end-of-life; coverage terminated.

## Second-Party Use

The **Satellite Operator (Startups / Telcos)** benefits from verification.

**Launch Authorization:** Before a rocket company (e.g., SpaceX or Rocket Lab) allows a satellite onto their vehicle, they demand proof of insurance. The operator shows the verified hash. "Verified by AXA XL" gives the launch provider the cryptographic proof needed to integrate the payload, removing the risk of "Un-Insured Payload" liability.

**Debt Financing:** Satellite operators often borrow against their orbital assets. A verified "In-Orbit" hash allows lenders to see the current value and status of the collateral, speeding up the release of working capital.

## Third-Party Use

**Space Agencies (NASA / ESA)**
**Licensing Compliance:** Verifying that commercial operators are maintaining the mandatory Third-Party Liability insurance required by international space treaties (e.g., Outer Space Treaty).

**Telecommunications Partners**
**Service Reliability Audit:** A company buying "Bandwidth" from a satellite operator scans the verified insurance hash. This ensures that if the satellite fails, the operator has the funds to compensate them for the outage.

**Secondary Insurance Markets**
**Re-Insurance Vetting:** Large specialist insurers often "Sell off" parts of a $500M risk to re-insurers. Verified hashes ensure that the technical details of the mission (the rocket type, the orbit) match what was reported.

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-Altitude" Fraud Problem**

- **Payload Padding:** Inflation of the "In-Orbit Value" to get a higher insurance payout if the satellite degrades.
- **Vehicle Spoofing:** Changing a high-risk rocket name to a "Proven" rocket name on a PDF to lower the premium or trick a partner.
- **Exclusion Masking:** Removing a "Debris Collision" exclusion before selling the satellite to a new owner.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Specialized Global Space Insurers.**
**Lloyd's of London Space Syndicates.**
**National Space Defense Bureaus.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Satellite frequencies, orbits, and technical specs are high-value trade secrets. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized aerospace partners.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Atrium Underwriters issues satellite and space insurance policies and is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance framework and outer space regulations.

```
✓ satellite.atrium-uw.com/verify — Speciality space and satellite insurer
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Space is the "Final Frontier of Risk." By turning specialty policies into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the billions of dollars flowing into the new space economy and ensure that "Mission Success" is backed by the professional truth of the insurer.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (satellite ID, COSPAR ID, launch window, in-orbit value, policy number) — never plaintext or sensitive trade secret information — providing non-repudiation of the satellite insurance policy.
