## What are Salvage and Subrogation Records?

In the insurance industry, **Salvage** refers to the value recovered from a "Total Loss" asset (e.g., selling a wrecked car for parts). **Subrogation** is the process where an insurer (who paid a claim) pursues the at-fault party to get their money back.

These documents are the "Recovery Ledger" of the insurance world. Fraud is common in the "Secondary Car Market." Dishonest flippers "Wash" a salvage title by creating a fake PDF that shows the vehicle was "Repaired and Inspected" by a famous carrier like Allstate, when it actually should have been crushed. Similarly, a third party might "edit" a subrogation letter to hide that they owe $50,000 to an insurance pool. Verified hashes bind the **VIN, Salvage Value, and At-Fault Party ID** to the carrier's or the salvage yard's domain (e.g., `copart.com` or `geico.com`).

## Data Verified

VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), Claim ID, insurer name (NAIC), insured name (masked), salvage lot number, date of total loss declaration, actual cash value (ACV), repair estimate amount, salvage bid price, subrogation target ID, payment recovery status.

**Document Types:**
- **Salvage Certificate:** The primary title-branding document.
- **Subrogation Demand Letter:** The formal request for payment from the at-fault party.
- **Release of Liability:** Signed after subrogation is settled.
- **Certificate of Destruction:** Proof the asset was crushed (non-repairable).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`geico.com`, `copart.com`, `iaai.com`) and the asset standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Total Loss / Salvage** — Asset is officially non-clean title.
- **Subrogation Pending** — **ALERT:** The insurer is actively seeking $10,000+ from the at-fault party.
- **Subrogation Satisfied** — Debt has been settled; liability released.
- **Destroyed** — **CRITICAL:** Asset serial number is flagged as "Scrapped"; any physical appearance is fraudulent.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insurer / At-Fault Party** benefits from verification.

**Settlement Finality:** An uninsured driver who pays $5,000 to an insurer to settle a subrogation claim can receive a verified hash. If the insurer's "Collection Agency" accidentally contacts them 2 years later, the driver can show the verified "Settled" status on their phone to stop the harassment instantly.

**Fleet Value Recovery:** A corporate fleet manager can provide verified salvage hashes to their accounting department to prove the exact "Residual Value" recovered from a wrecked truck, ensuring accurate depreciation and tax reporting.

## Third-Party Use

**Used Car Buyers (The Public)**
**Title-Wash Protection:** Before buying a "Clean" 2024 Tesla from a private seller, the buyer scans the VIN plate. If the hash returns **"TOTAL LOSS - GEICO,"** they know the seller has "Washed" the title through a different state to hide its history, potentially saving the buyer $30,000 and a dangerous drive.

**Collection Agencies**
**Debt Vetting:** Before buying a portfolio of "Subrogation Debts," the agency scans the hashes. Verification ensures the debts are authentic, haven't been "Satisfied" already, and that the "At-Fault" findings match the original carrier's digital file.

**State DMVs**
**Registration Vetting:** Automatically checking verified salvage hashes during out-of-state title transfers to ensure a "branded" title is correctly carried over.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Clean" Fraud Problem**

- **Title Washing:** Registering a salvage car in a "lax" state to get a new "Clean" paper title to hide a major accident.
- **Bid Shilling:** Editing a salvage receipt to show a lower bid price to evade "Sales Tax" or to hide a profit.
- **Demand Inflation:** Changing a "$5,000 Subrogation Demand" into a "$15,000" one to scare an un-insured driver into an over-settlement.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Auto Insurers.**
**Global Salvage Auctions (Copart, IAAI).**
**Specialized Subrogation Recovery Firms.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. VINs and claim amounts are sensitive private data. The hash must be salted to prevent "VIN Harvesting" by data brokers or competitive-intelligence firms.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

UK insurers issue salvage and subrogation documentation and are regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance framework and marine insurance laws.

```
✓ subrogation.example-insurer.co.uk/verify — Insurance carrier managing total loss and subrogation recovery
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Salvage documentation is the "History of Failure" for an asset. By turning total-loss records into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the public from dangerous "Zombies" (rebuilt wrecks) and ensure that the multi-billion dollar subrogation market is based on the digital truth of the claim.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's or salvage operator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (VIN, claim ID, salvage value, at-fault party ID, recovery status) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the salvage certificate and subrogation demand.
