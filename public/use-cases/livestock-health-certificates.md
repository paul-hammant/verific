## Data Verified

Animal unique ID (Microchip/Tag), Consignor/Consignee names, Species/Breed, Gender, Age, specific disease test results (e.g., Coggins for horses, TB for cattle), vaccination history, accredited veterinarian name/license, date of inspection, origin/destination premises.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI):** Mandatory for interstate/international move.
- **Equine Infectious Anemia (Coggins) Lab Report:** Essential for horse travel.
- **Import/Export Health Certificate:** (Form 7001 equivalent).

See also: [Breed Pedigree and Registration](breed-pedigree-registration.md) for lineage/registry verification.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`tahc.texas.gov`, `usda.gov`) and current health/legal standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Health certificate matches the state vet's official digital filing.
- **Quarantined** — **ALERT:** Disease detected at origin; movement prohibited.
- **Expired** — CVIs are typically only valid for 30 days.

## Second-Party Use

The **Animal Owner / Shipper** benefits from verification.

**Interstate Transport:** Proving to a State Police or Ag-Inspector at a roadside checkpoint that the 10 horses in the trailer have verified "Negative Coggins" and active CVIs. This prevents the truck from being impounded or the animals being forced into a 14-day mandatory quarantine.

**Auction Sales:** Proving to potential buyers at a high-value cattle or horse auction that the animal's health status isn't fabricated.

## Third-Party Use

**Roadside Ag-Inspectors (CBP / State Troopers)**
**Disease Control:** Instantly verifying the health status of animals at the border. Live Verify allows the officer to focus on trucks with unverified or "Forged" paper, stopping outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth or Avian Flu before they spread.

**Show Organizers**
**Entry Vetting:** Ensuring that all 500 horses at a national show have verified vaccinations, protecting the entire population from contagious outbreaks.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Biosecurity" Fraud Problem**

- **Certificate Forgery:** Using a color printer to create a "Clean CVI" for a sick horse to sneak it into a prestigious show or across a state line.
- **Microchip Swapping:** Claiming a health certificate belongs to a healthy animal when the person is actually shipping a sick one. Verification of the *Microchip ID Hash* prevents this.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Veterinarian Offices.**
**USDA APHIS.**
**Electronic CVI Platforms:** (e.g., GlobalVetLink - hosting the hashes).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Livestock owner names and farm locations are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Cattle Rustling" groups from mapping high-value herds.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Veterinarians issue livestock health certificates under veterinary regulator authority (RCVS in the UK).

```
✓ vet.apha.gov.uk/health-cert/verify — Issues livestock health certificates
  ✓ rcvs.org.uk — Regulates veterinary surgeons in the UK
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the State Veterinarian's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (animal ID, microchip, test results, vaccination dates) — never owner or farm location plaintext — providing non-repudiation of the health certificate and an audit trail biosecurity officials can inspect.


## Competition vs. Electronic CVI (GlobalVetLink)

| Feature | Live Verify | eCVI Platforms (GVL) | Paper CVI Form |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the State Vet. | **System-Bound.** Trust the vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper at the border. | **Difficult.** Requires inspectors to have specific app logins. | **Instant.** |
| **Adoption** | **High.** Works with existing paper workflows. | **Medium.** Requires all vets to use the same software. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Microchip.** Protects the data. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Roadside Realities." Border inspectors work in booths with limited time. They don't have logins to 15 different private veterinary platforms. Live Verify turns the **Mandatory Paper Certificate** into a universal digital bridge, bringing "Blockchain-level" biosecurity to the physical checkpoint.
