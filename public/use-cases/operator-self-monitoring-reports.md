## What is an Operator Self-Monitoring Report?

Many regulatory regimes do not send an inspector to take the reading. They require the **operator to measure itself and report the number** — then check only a sample of those reports. This is *self-reporting* (not self-*regulation*): the legal limits still come from a regulator, but the routine data that proves compliance is generated, held, and published by the very party it judges.

The pattern is everywhere: a water company reporting its own sewage-discharge and spill data; a factory filing its own emissions readings; a food business logging its own hygiene checks; a fund publishing its own ESG or carbon figures; a plant reporting its own workplace-injury count. In each case the operator asserts a figure, the regulator *may* spot-check it, and a penalty follows *if* a discrepancy is caught.

The weakness is structural and was named plainly in public discussion of the 2025 Southern Water fraud charges: self-reporting is fine **"as long as the government does spot checks"** — but stopping the spot checks costs nothing and leaves no trace. Verification that depends on a regulator's discretionary, defundable audit budget decays silently. A stronger design makes each self-report **tamper-evident and cheaply checkable by anyone** — regulator, journalist, downstream operator, or citizen — so the load-bearing signal is math anyone can run, not a line item someone can quietly cut.

Live Verify binds each published report — the **reporting period, the outfall/site, the measured values, and the "as-measured" date** — to the operator's own domain. The operator can still be wrong or dishonest about the *underlying measurement*; what it can no longer do is silently restate history, alter a figure undetectably, or show one number to the regulator and a different one to the public.

## Data Verified

Operator name, permit number, site and outfall identifiers, reporting period (start/end), sample basis (continuous / spot / self-monitored), each reported parameter with its regulatory limit and the self-measured value, spill-event counts and durations, the "as-measured" date, and the reporting officer's reference. The hash binds the *exact figures as published for that period* to the operator's domain.

**Document Types:**
- **Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR):** Periodic self-measured effluent/spill return.
- **Emissions Self-Report:** Stack/process emissions filed by the operator.
- **Event Duration Monitoring return:** Storm-overflow spill counts and hours.
- **Self-audit log:** Food-safety, workplace-injury, or process-check records.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the operator's domain (e.g. `southernwater.co.uk`) and the standing of *this specific return*. The endpoint confirms authenticity and state — it does **not** re-echo the figures (the verifier already has them on the page or placard).

**Status Indications:**
- **Published / Current** — This return is the operator's live figure for the period.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A later corrected return exists for the same period; this one is stale. (A silent restatement is exactly what tamper-evidence exposes.)
- **Under Regulator Review** — The reported figures are being audited or challenged.
- **Withdrawn** — **CRITICAL:** The operator has retracted this return.

## Second-Party Use

The **regulator (case officer)** benefits directly. When the Environment Agency, EPA, or Ofwat receives a return, verifying the hash proves the operator cannot later claim it "meant to file a different number." The as-published figure is fixed at source. This turns "we corrected a typo" from an untraceable edit into a visible **Superseded** transition with both versions on record — narrowing the space between honest correction and quiet cover-up.

## Third-Party Use

**Environmental NGOs / Citizen Groups**
A community group can scan or select a published spill return and verify it against the operator's own domain. If the operator later scrubs or restates the figure, the previously verified hash surfaces the change — providing the evidentiary basis for a citizen suit or a complaint to the regulator. This is the direct countermeasure to "stopping the spot checks does not [take bureaucracy]": the check no longer depends on the regulator's budget.

**Journalists and Watchdogs**
A reporter comparing an operator's public statements to its filed data can cite a verified hash rather than a screenshot — self-evidencing, and resistant to "that figure was never on our site" denials.

**Downstream Operators and Investors**
A water abstractor, a supply-chain auditor, or an ESG analyst can confirm that the figures in a report match what the operator published to its regulator, not a prettier version prepared for them.

## Verification Architecture

**The self-reporting fraud problem**

- **Silent restatement:** Editing a past return to lower an exceedance after the fact, with no visible trace.
- **Audience-splitting:** Publishing one spill count to the public and filing another to the regulator.
- **Selective disappearance:** Quietly deleting an inconvenient period once attention moves on.

Live Verify addresses each: a restatement forces a **Superseded** transition (both hashes exist); audience-splitting is impossible when the same domain-anchored hash serves everyone; a deletion turns a previously **Published** hash into a 404, which is itself a finding.

**The honest limit (stated plainly).** Live Verify verifies **what was reported, when, and that it is unaltered** — it does **not** prove the self-measured number is *physically true*. An operator can honestly hash a falsified reading. Catching a falsified *measurement* still requires a physical audit, an independent sensor, or a sample check. This use case does not replace the spot check — it makes the spot check's *absence* survivable, by ensuring the reported record cannot be rewritten between checks. Authentic-as-of-its-date is not the same as true-now; see the point-in-time distinction below.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

The **operator itself** is the issuer here — that is the defining feature of self-reporting, and the reason tamper-evidence matters more than in regulator-issued documents. Relevant operators: water and wastewater utilities, industrial emitters, food businesses, and any entity filing its own regulatory monitoring data.

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Statutory environmental returns are public by law. Individual staff names on the return and any commercially sensitive process detail should be salted.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Self-anchored, regulator-witnessed

Because the operator is the issuer, the chain deliberately shows the **regulator as the anchoring root** — the operator's self-published return resolves upward to the authority whose limits it is reporting against. This keeps the human judgement honest: an operator vouching only for itself is the *amber* case; a return that also resolves to the regulator's namespace is the anchored case.

```
? southernwater.co.uk/returns/v — Operator self-published monitoring return (self-anchored)
  ✓ environment-agency.gov.uk/permits/verify — Environment Agency, permit ENV-2026-44120
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition vs. Regulator Databases and Public Portals

| Approach | Weakness | Live Verify contribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Regulator spot-check audit** | Discretionary and defundable; stopping it leaves no trace | Per-report check needs no audit budget; anyone can run it |
| **Operator's public data portal** | Operator controls the page; can restate or delete silently | Domain-anchored hash makes restatement a visible `Superseded`/404 event |
| **Screenshots / archived pages** | Repudiable ("never on our site"); no cryptographic tie | Self-evidencing hash bound to the operator's own domain |
| **Trusting the filed number** | Says nothing about whether the figure was later altered | Fixes the as-published figure at source; tamper-evident |

Live Verify is **complementary** to these controls, not a replacement — it secures the *integrity and non-repudiation of the self-report*, leaving the *truth of the measurement* to physical audit.

## Related Use Cases

- **[Stormwater Discharge Permits (NPDES)](view.html?doc=stormwater-discharge-permits)** — the *permit* that sets the limits this report is filed against.
- **[Regulatory Compliance Attestations](view.html?doc=regulatory-compliance-attestations)** — a *regulator's* confirmation of compliance (the audit layer that self-reporting bypasses).
- **[Environmental Liability & Pollution](view.html?doc=environmental-liability-pollution)** — the insurance/liability document for pollution events.
- **[Incident Reporting](view.html?doc=incident-reporting)** — event-driven self-reports of a single occurrence.

## Rationale

Self-reporting is not inherently bad — as the public discussion of the Southern Water case put it, "the problem is that you need to validate." What fails is validation that depends on a discretionary, invisible-to-remove spot check. Live Verify does not audit the operator; it removes the operator's ability to edit its own history undetectably, so that when validation *does* happen — by a regulator, an NGO, or a journalist — there is a fixed, domain-anchored record to validate against. It makes the gap between spot checks safe to live in.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the operator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (site/outfall identifiers, reporting period, parameter names and limits) — never individual measured values or commercially sensitive process details — providing non-repudiation of self-monitoring return publication and restatement events.
