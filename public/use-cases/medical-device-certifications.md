## Data Verified

Manufacturer legal name, facility location, Notified Body ID (e.g., 0086), Certificate number, Device classification (I, IIa, IIb, III), specific model numbers, ISO standards met, issue date, expiration date, regulatory pathway (MDR/IVDR).

### Scope enrichment: which device class, and which models

The characteristic fraud is *scope misrepresentation* — a certificate for "Bandages" edited or reused
to read "Surgical Implants" for a price premium. A device certificate carries no personal data, so on
verification the Notified Body can safely **echo the exact covered scope** — the
`device_classification`, the specific `models_covered`, the `standards`, and the
`recertification_due`. A buyer then confirms the device *in front of them* is within the certificate's
class and model list, so a Class I certificate cannot be read as covering a Class III implant, and a
lapsed certificate reads as such. Safe enrichment — no personal data, revealing the scope the terse
claim withheld (see
[safety-certifications](safety-certifications.md) and
[verification-enrichment-hazards.md](../../docs/verification-enrichment-hazards.md)).

**Document Types:**
- **CE Certificate of Conformity:** Mandatory for the European market.
- **FDA 510(k) Clearance Letter:** For U.S. market entry.
- **ISO 13485 QMS Certificate:** Proving the factory meets quality laws.
- **Biocompatibility Test Report:** (Linked hash) proving the material is safe.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Device meets all regulatory safety standards
- **RECALLED** — Safety defect found; do not implant/use; remove from inventory
- **SUSPENDED** — Certificate paused (e.g., due to audit failure); do not use until resolved
- **WITHDRAWN** — Permanently revoked due to severe non-compliance; do not use
- **404** — Certificate not found (forged document, wrong certificate number, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the certificate itself (e.g., `certs.bsigroup.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

None typically. The verification confirms the device certification status; that's the decision point for use.

**Why No Further Action:**

- **Hospital procurement** just needs status to accept or quarantine a shipment
- **Surgeons** just need confirmation before proceeding with implant
- **Customs agents** just need pass/fail for import clearance

The status code is the value. If it's OK, proceed. If it's RECALLED, SUSPENDED, WITHDRAWN, or 404, quarantine the device.

**Device Registration for Recalls:**

Implant registries (linking device serial numbers to patients for recall notification) are valuable but are typically managed by hospitals or manufacturer-run registries — not through a verification endpoint. The verification answers "is this device certified?" not "track this device to this patient."

## Second-Party Use

The **Medical Device Manufacturer** benefits from verification.

**Global Sales:** Proving to a hospital procurement team in Singapore or Dubai that their "EU CE Mark" isn't a fake document. A verified hash from BSI or TUV allows the manufacturer to bypass months of manual "Consular Legalization" of their certificates.

**Distributor Vetting:** Proving to an international distributor that the product has verified FDA clearance, allowing them to legally import and stock the device.

## Third-Party Use

**Hospital Procurement (Supply Chain)**
**Patient Safety:** Before allowing a new heart valve or surgical suture into the operating room, the hospital registrar scans the hash. "Verified by BSI" ensures the vendor isn't using a "MedPro-style" fake certificate to sell un-tested, dangerous medical gear.

**Customs / Port Authorities**
**Enforcement:** Border agents can scan the hash on the shipping crate. Verification ensure the devices aren't "Regulatory-Grade" fakes from an un-vetted factory.

**Insurance Carriers (Medical Malpractice)**
**Risk Rating:** Verifying that a hospital only uses verified, non-recalled medical devices, reducing the risk of surgical failure claims.

## Verification Architecture

**The "MedPro" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Certificates:** Shady testing firms selling fake CE certificates to manufacturers of cheap masks and surgical tools (The MedPro/Intertek Scandal).
- **Scope Misrepresentation:** Taking a certificate for "Bandages" and editing the PDF to read "Surgical Implants" to charge a 100x price premium.
- **Recall Hiding:** Continuing to sell a device after the Notified Body has "Withdrawn" the certificate due to safety failures.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Notified Bodies (EU):** (BSI, TUV, SGS, Dekra).
**Regulatory Agencies:** (FDA, EMA, MHRA).
**Accredited Testing Labs:** (ISO 17025 labs).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Notified bodies issue medical device certifications under healthcare products regulator authority (MHRA in the UK).

```
✓ devices.bsigroup.com/verify — Issues medical device certifications
  ✓ mhra.gov.uk — Regulates UK medicines and medical devices
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the Notified Body's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (certificate numbers, manufacturer names, device classifications, model numbers, standards, expiry dates) — never sensitive commercial information — providing non-repudiation of the device certification.

## Competition vs. EUDAMED / FDA Databases

| Feature | Live Verify | EUDAMED / FDA Database | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Notified Body. | **Gov-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at procurement. | **Slow.** Requires searching by school name and state. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Models.** Protects the specific part #s. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect the paper. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Immediacy** | **Real-time.** Shows "RECALLED" status in red. | **Laggy.** Database updates can take days. | **Hidden.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Point of Care" reality. Doctors and hospital clerks work with paper and PDF boxes. They don't have the time to navigate complex federal government databases for every shipment. Live Verify turns the **Static Certificate** into a live "Safety Beacon," ensuring that "Medical Integrity" is verified at the moment of highest risk.
