## What is Crop-Hail Insurance?

For a farmer, a single 10-minute hailstorm can destroy an entire year's income. **Crop-Hail Insurance** protects against this specific risk.

Unlike broader "Multi-Peril" insurance (which is subsidized by the government), Crop-Hail is a private contract that pays out based on the exact percentage of damage to specific acres.

Farmers use these verified coverage schedules to secure "Operating Loans" from banks. If a farmer "Photoshops" their policy to show more insured acres, they are committing bank fraud. Verified hashes allow the bank to see the true, insurer-backed limits in the field.

## Data Verified

Insured name, farm location (Section/Township/Range), specific crop types, acreage per crop, limit of insurance per acre, total policy liability, effective date (emergence), expiration date (harvest), issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Coverage Schedule:** The summary of insured fields and values.
- **Acreage Report:** The final signed declaration of what was planted.
- **Notice of Loss:** (Linked hash) proving a claim was filed immediately after a storm.
- **Adjuster's Final Stand Count:** Proving the % of damage verified in the field.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`rainhail.com`, `fmh.com`) and current policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; crops are covered.
- **Adjusted** — Acreage report finalized; limits locked.
- **Claim Pending** — Storm reported; adjuster assigned.
- **Paid** — Claim settled and funds issued to the farmer.

## Second-Party Use

The **Farmer** benefits from verification.

**Bank Financing:** Proving to an ag-lender (e.g., Farm Credit) that the 2026 corn crop is "Verified Insured" for $800/acre. This allows the bank to use the crop as collateral for an operating loan to buy fertilizer and fuel.

**Landlord Trust:** In "Crop-Share" leases, proving to the landowner that their share of the harvest is fully protected against hail damage.

## Third-Party Use

**Ag-Lenders (Banks)**
**Collateral Protection:** Banks need to ensure that the farmer hasn't "Edited" the policy limits to look higher than they are. Verification ensures the bank's loan is fully backed by an authentic Chubb/Rain & Hail policy.

**Crop Adjusters**
**Field Integrity:** When an adjuster arrives at a field after a storm, they scan the "Acreage Report" on their tablet. "Verified by Home Office" ensures the farmer hasn't quietly "Added" the damaged field to the policy *after* the storm happened (Backdating).

**Grain Elevators**
**Forward Contracts:** Verifying that a farmer has the insurance to back up a forward-delivery contract, reducing the risk of "Default due to weather."

## Verification Architecture

**The "Storm Chasing" Fraud Problem**

- **Post-Storm Enrollment:** Trying to buy a policy after a hail-storm has already hit, and backdating the "Emergence Date" on the paper form.
- **Acreage Inflation:** Claiming to have 1,000 insured acres on the paper summary shown to the bank, while only paying for 500 acres at the insurance company.
- **Entity Fraud:** Using a "Clean" family member's name to get insurance after the primary farmer has been barred for prior fraud.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Private Crop Insurers:** (Rain & Hail, Farmers Mutual Hail, NAU Country).
**USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA):** (Overseeing the Federal MPCI program).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

NFU Mutual underwrites crop and hail insurance for UK agricultural operations.

```
✓ crop.nfu-mutual.co.uk/verify — Underwrites crop and hail insurance for agricultural operations
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the policy it issued.


## Competition vs. USDA Portals (MPCI)

| Feature | Live Verify | USDA / RMA Portal | Paper Schedule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds specific fields.** Protects the $/Acre limit. | **High.** Direct Gov DB. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Accessibility** | **Open.** Any local ag-bank can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires secure USDA ID and complex logins. | **Instant.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan at the farm gate. | **Slow.** Requires navigating a complex Gov GIS system. | **Instant.** |
| **Private Market** | **Universal.** Works for non-gov "Hail-Only" policies. | **Zero.** USDA doesn't track private hail-only data. | **Manual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Ag-Banking" reality. Many farmers use private "Crop-Hail" policies *on top* of federal MPCI. The USDA database doesn't see these private contracts. Live Verify allows the **Private Insurer** to provide the same level of cryptographic trust as the government, ensuring the farmer's total risk strategy is verifiable.
