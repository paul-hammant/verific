## What is a Verified Nanny Badge?

When you hire a nanny or babysitter from an app (like Care.com), they have supposedly passed a criminal background check.

The **Provider ID Badge** is the digital or physical card the nanny carries. It proves:
1.  **Identity:** The person at your door is the one who passed the check.
2.  **Safety:** They have a clear criminal and sex-offender record.
3.  **Training:** They are certified in First Aid and CPR.

Tragically, some people use "ID Swapping"—using a sibling's clear background check to get work while they themselves have a criminal history. Scanning the badge at the door and seeing the "Verified" photo from the network stops this instantly.

**The substitution problem is the critical risk here.** The credential may be genuine — a real background check, a real first aid certificate — but worn by the wrong person. A verified badge with a `photo_url` in the verification response catches this: the parent sees the platform's photo of the person who passed the check and compares it to the person standing in their kitchen. This is not a background check bypass; it is identity binding at the moment of care. The consequences of getting this wrong are not financial — they are the safety of a child left alone with a stranger whose real identity is unknown.

## Data Verified

Provider name, photo (hash), background check status (Clear/Fail), background check date, first aid/CPR certification, childcare training (e.g., CDA), state registry ID, reference count.

**Document Types:**
- **Provider ID Badge:** Carried by the nanny/babysitter.
- **Background Check Report Summary:** Extract from a firm like Checkr.
- **First Aid Certification:** Red Cross or AHA card.
- **State License:** For licensed home-daycare operators.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Background check is clear and certifications are active
- **EXPIRED** — Background check or first aid certification has lapsed; request updated credentials
- **ALERT** — Disciplinary action or safety report found; proceed with extreme caution
- **REVOKED** — Barred from the platform/profession; do not hire
- **404** — Provider not found (forged badge, terminated account, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `care.com`, `ofsted.gov.uk`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, parents may record the care session:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

--- Optional Follow-Up ---

You may record details of this care session.
You will NEVER be told not to do this or that it is not needed.

POST to: https://care.com/parent-feedback/session

Fields:
- Care type: [Babysitting / Nanny shift / Date night / Backup care / Other]
- Duration: [Less than 4 hours / 4-8 hours / Full day / Overnight]
- Children's ages: [Infant / Toddler / Preschool / School-age]
- Care quality: [Excellent / Good / Concerns]
- Any concerns or issues?
- Would you hire again? [Y/N]
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Pattern detection:** Provider receiving frequent "concerns" across multiple families triggers platform review
- **Child safety:** Creates contemporaneous record if issues emerge later
- **Quality signal:** Good providers benefit from consistent positive feedback
- **Trust ecosystem:** Parents can see aggregate feedback patterns (not individual reports)

**The "Never Discouraged" Principle:**

Providers should never tell parents "don't bother" or "that's not necessary." Every report is logged. The platform can triage later—but the parent is never made to feel their input isn't wanted. Given the vulnerability of children, parental instincts should always be respected.

## Second-Party Use

The **Childcare Provider** benefits from verification.

**Competitive Advantage:** Proving to parents that they aren't just "somebody from the internet," but a verified professional who has passed a recent, rigorous background check. This allows them to charge higher rates.

**Seamless Onboarding:** Instead of handing over sensitive SSN/address data to every new parent for a background check, they simply show their "Verified Badge."

## Third-Party Use

**Parents / Guardians**
**Absolute Confidence:** Before leaving their child with a stranger, parents scan the badge. "Verified by Care.com" provides the peace of mind that the person standing in their kitchen is exactly who they claim to be and has no criminal record.

**Childcare Platforms (Apps)**
**Trust Management:** Ensuring that providers aren't sharing accounts or using fake names to hide past bans.

**Insurance Companies**
**Homeowners Coverage:** Verifying that domestic staff are qualified, which can impact liability coverage for in-home accidents.

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-Stakes" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Swapping:** Using a "Clean" sibling's ID to pass a background check while the person actually working has a criminal record.
- **Photoshop Forgery:** Editing an old "Cleared" PDF from 3 years ago to show a "MAR 2026" date.
- **Fake Certifications:** Printing a fake Red Cross First Aid card from a template.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Childcare Networks:** (Care.com, UrbanSitter, Sittercity).
**Background Check Firms:** (Checkr, Sterling, HireRight).
**Government Regulators:** (e.g., U.K. Ofsted, state Licensing Boards).

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Childcare data is personal. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guessing" the names of providers in a neighborhood.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Childcare providers are inspected and registered through Ofsted, which maintains the official register of all childcare professionals in England.

```
✓ ofsted.gov.uk/childminder/verify — Issues childcare provider verification
  ✓ ofsted.gov.uk — Inspects childcare and education in England
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the childcare network or regulator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the verification it issued.


## Competition vs. Physical References

| Feature | Live Verify | Phone References | Background Check PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Platform. | **Personal.** Easy to have a friend "pretend" to be a prior boss. | **Zero.** Easily forged with a PDF editor. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Links face to status. | **Subjective.** | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires multiple phone calls. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if banned *today*. | **N/A.** | **Static.** |

**Why this remains strong:** The front-door workflow is the real constraint. Parents often interview several sitters in a short period and do not have time to chase references or rerun background checks at the threshold. Platform and agency systems remain primary in the background, but the sitter's badge or profile surface is what the parent actually sees. That makes this a strong complementary home-entry verification case.
