## What is a Verified Fact-Check?

In the era of "Fake News" and AI-generated text, it is trivial to create a realistic-looking news article or quote from a politician that is 100% false.

A **Verified Fact-Check** adds a cryptographic anchor to a news story.

It allows a reader to scan the text and see a green "VERIFIED" status from an independent watchdog (like Snopes or PolitiFact). More importantly, it stops the "Archival Erasure" problem: a newspaper cannot "Silently Edit" its old articles to change history if the original text is already hashed and verified on an external domain.

      <p>A fire broke out on the 38th floor of Northbridge Tower yesterday evening, prompting the evacuation of 47 employees. Fairport Fire Department responded within 4 minutes of the initial alarm.</p>
      <p>"All personnel were evacuated safely," said Fire Chief Marcus Stone. "The sprinkler system contained the blaze until our units arrived."</p>

## Data Verified

Full published text (digest), author name, date of publication, fact-checker organization, list of verified sources (anonymized or linked), presence of corrections/retractions, primary source timestamps.

**Document Types:**
- **Verified News Article:** The "Persistent Truth" version of a story.
- **Academic Citation Extract:** Proving a quote matches the original paper.
- **Political Statement Audit:** Independent review of campaign claims.
- **Corporate Disclosure:** Proving earnings data matches the auditor's review.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the independent Fact-Checking Org) and the current story status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — The text matches the version reviewed by the fact-checker.
- **Correction Active** — A factual error was found; click for the updated version.
- **Disputed** — Conflict between sources; review the "Discussion" page.
- **Retracted** — **ALERT:** The publication has withdrawn this story due to integrity failure.

## Second-Party Use

The **News Organization / Journalist** benefits from verification.

**Defamation Defense:** Proving in court that the paper performed a verified, timestamped fact-check *before* publication. This demonstrates "Good Faith" and absence of "Actual Malice," which is the primary defense in high-stakes libel lawsuits.

**Brand Trust:** Displaying the "Verified by Snopes/IFCN" badge on a controversial investigation to reassure readers that the claims aren't "Fake News."

## Third-Party Use

**Social Media Platforms (X / Meta)**
**Algorithmic Trust:** Platforms can use the verification hash to prioritize "Verified Facts" in the feed, reducing the reach of unverified or altered screenshots of news stories.

**Historians / Researchers**
**Archival Integrity:** Ensuring that a digitized article from 20 years ago hasn't been "Silently Edited" to change political history (e.g., the "Orwellian" disappearance of inconvenient facts).

**Legal Teams**
**Discovery Proof:** Verifying that a published statement used as evidence in a trial matches the exact text at the time of publication.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Memory Hole" Fraud Problem**

- **Silent Editing:** A publication quietly changing a quote or a number in an old article after a scandal breaks, to pretend they "were right all along."
- **Screenshot Forgery:** Scammers creating fake news "Screenshots" that look like they come from the NY Times or Daily Ledger to manipulate stock prices or elections.
- **Deepfake Quotes:** Attributing fabricated statements to real public figures using realistic-looking web templates.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Independent Fact-Checkers:** (Snopes, PolitiFact, Full Fact).
**Global Media Outlets.**
**Academic Integrity Boards.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical for "Anonymous Source" protection. The hash must be salted to ensure that searching for a source doesn't inadvertently reveal their identity through pattern matching.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Fact-checking organizations and editorial outlets issue fact-check verdicts and corrections. Self-authorized by their journalistic standards and editorial independence.

```
✓ factcheck.reuters.com/verify — Issues fact-checking verdicts and editorial corrections
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the fact-checker's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (article text digests, author names, publication dates, fact-checker organizations, source timestamps) — never source identities, unnamed source locations, or attribution details — providing non-repudiation of the fact-check verdict and an audit trail regulators and historians can inspect.

## Competition vs. Community Notes (X)

| Feature | Live Verify | Community Notes (Social) | Blockchains (Numbers Protocol) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Fact-Checker. | **Social-Bound.** Trust the "Crowd" consensus. | **Byzantine.** Trust the decentralized ledger. |
| **Authority** | **Expert.** Relies on professional ethics. | **Democratic.** Prone to mob-rule/bias. | **Technological.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Text.** Protects every comma. | **Vague.** Only annotates the link. | **High.** But requires technical wallet. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Verified at publication. | **Slow.** Takes hours/days for a note to appear. | **Variable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Expert Accountability. Community Notes are great for context, but they are often biased by the loudest voices. Live Verify turns the **Professional Fact-Checker's Opinion** into a cryptographically anchored fact that survives long after the social media "Outrage Cycle" has moved on.
