## What is a Registered Agent Letter?

A **Registered Agent Letter** (also called a comfort letter, confirmation letter, or CSP letter) is a document issued by a Corporate Service Provider (CSP) — the offshore firm that acts as the registered agent for shell companies. It confirms basic facts about the entity: it exists, these are its directors, this is its registered office, and the agent acts on its behalf.

Every offshore company must have a registered agent in its jurisdiction of incorporation. In the BVI, roughly 400,000 active companies are serviced by a handful of large CSPs (Harneys, Conyers, Maples, Vistra, Trident). These agents are the gatekeepers — they hold the statutory records, file annual returns, and issue the letters that banks and counterparties rely on for KYC.

The problem: registered agent letters are the most trusted yet most easily forged document in offshore finance. A bank in Singapore receives a letter on Harneys BVI letterhead confirming that "Global Ventures Ltd, Company No. 1947283" has directors A and B and shareholder C. The bank has no way to confirm this letter is genuine without phoning Harneys directly — which takes days, assumes Harneys will respond to an unsolicited call (they often won't for confidentiality reasons), and doesn't scale when the bank processes hundreds of offshore entities per month.

Worse: some letters are genuine but misleading. The agent confirms the current directors, but the directors are nominees — professional directors who sit on hundreds of boards and have no operational role. The letter is technically accurate but creates a false impression of governance.

With Live Verify, the letter carries a `verify:` line bound to the CSP's domain. The bank scans it and gets instant confirmation that Harneys, Maples, or Vistra actually issued this specific letter with these specific claims.

## Data Verified

Company name, company number, date of incorporation, entity status, registered agent identity, directors (names and appointment dates), registered office address, date of letter, validity period.

**Document Types:**
- **Registered Agent Confirmation Letter:** Basic confirmation of entity existence and agent relationship.
- **Certificate of Incumbency:** Lists directors, officers, shareholders, and registered agent. Often issued by the agent rather than the registry.
- **Know-Your-Customer (KYC) Pack:** Bundle of documents the agent provides to banks — includes good standing certificate, incumbency certificate, director IDs, and the agent's own comfort letter.
- **Nominee Director Disclosure:** Agent confirms which directors are nominees (professional directors appointed by the agent) vs. principals.
- **Power of Attorney Confirmation:** Agent confirms that a specific individual holds power of attorney for the entity.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`harneys.com`, `maples.com`, `vistra.com`, `tridenttrust.com`, `conyers.com`) and letter status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Confirmed** — Letter was issued by this agent with these exact claims.
- **Superseded** — A newer letter has been issued with updated information (e.g., director change).
- **Withdrawn** — Agent has withdrawn the letter (e.g., relationship terminated, information found to be incorrect).
- **Expired** — Letter's validity window (typically 90 days) has passed.
- **Relationship Terminated** — Agent no longer acts for this entity.

## Second-Party Use

The **Company** (via its directors or ultimate beneficial owners) benefits from verification.

**Bank Account Opening:** The primary use. Offshore entities need bank accounts, and banks need KYC. A verified agent letter from Harneys' domain settles the authenticity question instantly. The bank still does its own KYC — but it no longer wastes weeks verifying that the agent letter itself is real.

**Fund Structuring:** When setting up a fund with a Cayman LP as the main vehicle and BVI feeders, the fund administrator needs agent letters for every entity in the structure. Verified letters for a 5-entity structure save weeks of back-and-forth.

**M&A Transactions:** In cross-border acquisitions involving offshore holding companies, the buyer's lawyers demand agent letters to confirm the target's corporate structure. Verified letters accelerate deal closings.

## Third-Party Use

**Banks (Compliance Teams)**

The single biggest impact. Banks process thousands of agent letters per year for offshore entity KYC. Currently, each letter requires manual verification — phoning the agent, emailing, waiting for callbacks that may not come due to confidentiality policies. Verified letters automate this entirely.

More importantly, verified letters reduce **de-risking**. Banks close accounts for entire categories of offshore entities partly because verifying their documentation is too expensive. If verification becomes instant and free, the cost-benefit calculation shifts — legitimate businesses keep their accounts.

**Correspondent Banking Partners**

When Bank A in Singapore banks an offshore entity and routes payments through Bank B in New York, Bank B needs assurance that Bank A's KYC is solid. Verified agent letters in Bank A's files give Bank B confidence without requiring Bank B to redo the entire KYC process.

**Opposing Counsel (Litigation)**

In cross-border disputes, establishing the corporate structure of an offshore entity group is a preliminary battleground. Lawyers spend months arguing about who the directors really are, whether the entity is validly constituted, and whether the agent relationship is genuine. Verified agent letters settle these preliminary questions.

**Tax Authorities**

When investigating offshore structures, tax authorities (HMRC, IRS, ATO) need to identify the directors and shareholders. Agent letters are key documents in these investigations — but investigators currently have no way to confirm the letters they receive from taxpayers are the same ones the agent issued.

**Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Investigators**

Financial intelligence units (FIUs) investigating money laundering through offshore structures need to trace corporate control. Agent letters are key evidence — but only if they're genuine. A forged letter naming the wrong directors can derail an investigation.

## Verification Architecture

**The Trust Problem**

Registered agent letters occupy a peculiar position in the trust hierarchy. The agent is not the government — it's a private firm. But it's a *regulated* private firm, licensed by the jurisdiction's financial services commission, and it holds statutory records that are not publicly available. Banks trust these letters more than they trust the company itself, but less than they trust a registry-issued certificate.

Live Verify doesn't change the trust hierarchy — it just makes the existing trust verifiable. If Harneys' domain confirms the letter, the bank knows Harneys actually issued it. The bank still has to decide whether it trusts Harneys.

**The Fraud Patterns**

- **Wholesale fabrication:** Forger creates a letter on Harneys letterhead (easily obtainable from previously received letters or Harneys' own website styling). The letter claims an entity exists with specific directors. The bank has no way to check without contacting Harneys directly.
- **Selective editing:** Genuine letter from Harneys, but the recipient edits the director names, swapping in different individuals. The formatting, signature, and reference number are real — only the substance is changed.
- **Stale letters:** Agent letter from 2023 presented as current when the directors have since been replaced. The letter was genuine when issued but no longer reflects reality.
- **Nominee concealment:** Letter accurately lists the directors but doesn't disclose that both are professional nominees appointed by the agent itself. The letter creates the false impression that the listed directors are the actual decision-makers.
- **Agent shopping:** When one agent terminates a relationship (e.g., due to suspicious activity), the entity moves to a less scrupulous agent who issues a fresh letter. The new letter doesn't mention the previous agent's concerns.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Major Offshore Corporate Service Providers:**
- Harneys Corporate Services (BVI, Cayman, Bermuda, Cyprus, Luxembourg)
- Maples Group (Cayman, BVI, Jersey, Ireland, Luxembourg)
- Conyers (Bermuda, BVI, Cayman, Hong Kong)
- Vistra (global — 49 jurisdictions)
- Trident Trust (BVI, Cayman, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Mauritius, Nevis, Panama)
- Intertrust (Netherlands, Luxembourg, Jersey, Cayman, Curaçao)
- TMF Group (global — 85 jurisdictions)
- Asiaciti Trust (Singapore, Samoa, Cook Islands, Nevis)
- Mossack Fonseca — defunct, but historically significant (Panama Papers)

**Privacy Salt:** High. Agent letters contain commercially sensitive information about directors and shareholders. The salt prevents enumeration attacks that could map the client portfolio of a specific agent. This is particularly sensitive because agent-client relationships are themselves confidential in most offshore jurisdictions.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Registered agents are licensed by offshore financial services regulators to issue corporate confirmation letters.

```
✓ harneys.com — Issues registered agent confirmation letters
  ✓ bvifsc.vg — Licenses offshore corporate service providers
    ✓ bvi.gov.vg — British Virgin Islands government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition

| Feature | Live Verify | Direct Contact with Agent | Registry Search | Apostilled Letter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Proves Letter Is Genuine** | **Yes.** Hash verified against agent's domain. | **Yes.** But slow and agent may refuse. | **N/A.** Registry doesn't issue agent letters. | **No.** Apostille proves notary, not content. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** | **Days to weeks.** Confidentiality policies delay responses. | **N/A.** | **Weeks.** |
| **Scalable** | **Yes.** Automated. | **No.** Manual phone/email per letter. | **N/A.** | **No.** Physical process. |
| **Detects Edits** | **Yes.** Any change to content breaks the hash. | **Only if agent reviews the specific letter.** | **N/A.** | **No.** |
| **Current Status** | **Yes.** WITHDRAWN/EXPIRED returned in real time. | **Only if asked.** | **N/A.** | **Point in time.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The core problem is that agent letters are the most relied-upon document in offshore KYC, yet the most difficult to verify. Direct contact with the agent — the current verification method — is slow, doesn't scale, and fails when the agent declines to respond (which happens routinely for confidentiality reasons). Live Verify gives the agent a way to confirm its letters without breaking confidentiality — the response is "yes, we issued this exact letter" without revealing anything the letter doesn't already say.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the corporate service provider's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (company number, letter date, company status, director names, agent name) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the registered agent letter and corporate status confirmation.

## Further Derivations

1. **Nominee Director Disclosure Letters** — Agent confirms which directors on its letter are nominees (professional directors) vs. principals. This is the critical missing piece in most agent letters — the bank sees "Director: John Smith" but doesn't know if John Smith is a real decision-maker or a professional nominee who sits on 200 boards. A verified disclosure, bound to the agent's domain, brings transparency to nominee arrangements without requiring public beneficial ownership registers.

2. **Power of Attorney Confirmations** — Agent confirms that a specific individual holds power of attorney for the entity, with defined scope and expiry. POAs are frequently forged in offshore fraud — someone presents themselves as authorized to act for a company when the company has never heard of them. Verified POA confirmations from the agent's domain prevent this.

3. **Agent Termination Notices** — When an agent terminates its relationship with an entity (due to unpaid fees, AML concerns, or client request), the termination notice becomes an important document. A verified termination notice proves the agent is no longer responsible for the entity — protecting the agent from liability and alerting third parties that the entity's documentation from this agent is no longer current.
