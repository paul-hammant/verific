## Data Verified

Depositor name, warehouse location ID, itemized lot numbers, product descriptions, current quantity on hand (units/pallets), total certified valuation, last audit timestamp, warehouse manager ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Warehouse Receipt:** Proving legal possession of goods.
- **Inventory Summary:** For monthly financial reporting.
- **Stock Transfer Note:** Moving goods between owners within the warehouse.
- **Cycle Count Report:** Proving frequent physical audits occurred.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Warehouse Operator) and current asset status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Custody** — Goods are physically present and verified.
- **Released** — Goods have been out-gated and removed from the ledger.
- **Pledged** — **ALERT:** Inventory is currently being used as collateral for a loan.
- **Void** — Report retracted due to counting error.

## Second-Party Use

The **Depositor** (second party) receives the inventory report from the warehouse operator (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of what goods are in custody. Most of the time, the report sits in their financial files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the inventory matches what the warehouse's system recorded and the goods are physically present.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about loan collateral, insurance claims, or auditor verification—they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the warehouse.

## Third-Party Use

The depositor (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Lenders / Banks**
**Collateral Monitoring:** Banks currently send physical "Auditors" to warehouses twice a year. Live Verify allows for **automated weekly verification**. If the inventory total drops or the hash status changes to "Released," the bank's loan system can trigger an immediate alert.

**Supply Chain Insurers**
**Risk Management:** Verifying the "Stock-on-Hand" before binding high-value cargo or spoilage insurance.

**Food Safety Regulators (FDA)**
**Traceability:** In the event of a recall, instantly verifying the "Lot Numbers" present in a warehouse to ensure contaminated food is quarantined.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Inventory" Fraud Problem**

- **Inventory Inflation:** A business owner editing the warehouse's PDF report to change "10 Pallets" to "100 Pallets" to trick a bank into giving a larger loan.
- **Double-Pledging:** Using the same 85 pallets of crab to secure loans from two different banks. Live Verify allows the status to be flagged as "Pledged," stopping the second loan.
- **Ghost Warehouses:** Creating fake "Warehouse Certificates" from non-existent facilities to hide the theft of company assets.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- 3PL Warehouse Operators (Global Cold Storage, Lineage, Americold)
- Logistics Management Systems (e.g., Manhattan Associates, HighJump - hosting the hashes)
- Independent Inventory Auditors

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Inventory reports contain many unpredictable variables that combine to create sufficient entropy—lot numbers (unique alphanumeric), product descriptions (varied and specific), precise quantity counts (continuous values), depositor-specific identifiers, warehouse location codes, and timestamp combinations. The variability in these fields makes reverse-engineering a specific inventory report computationally infeasible without already knowing all the details.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Warehouse operators and 3PL providers issue inventory reports certifying goods in custody. The issuer is self-authorized as the custodian responsible for accurate stock counts.

```
✓ inventory.example-warehouse.co.uk/verify — Certifies inventory quantities and valuation in warehouse custody
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the warehouse operator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (lot numbers, quantities, valuation amounts, depositor IDs, location codes) — never depositor names, detailed product specifications, or customer identities — providing non-repudiation of the inventory report and quantities and an audit trail financial institutions and regulators can inspect.

## Competition vs. WMS Portals (Warehouse Management)

| Feature | Live Verify | WMS Portal Access | Scanned PDF / Excel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Custodian. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Share with any bank/auditor. | **Restricted.** Third parties never get WMS logins. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the Lot counts. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't protect the paper doc. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Remains verifiable post-release. | **Low.** Records often archived/hidden in-app. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "External Auditor" reality. Banks and auditors are external to the supply chain. They work with "Static Artifacts" (PDF reports) sent via email. Live Verify turns those **Static Artifacts** into live digital anchors, providing the same trust as a live WMS login without the security risks.
