## What is Reverse Factoring?

In high-volume supply chains, **Reverse Factoring** (or Supply Chain Finance) allows a supplier to get paid early by a bank, based on the credit rating of their massive buyer (e.g., Apple, Walmart, or Boeing). The bank pays the supplier $98 today for a $100 invoice, and the buyer pays the bank $100 in 60 days.

These documents are the "Trade Collateral." Fraud is high-stakes: a dishonest supplier might create "Phantom Invoices" using a buyer's branding to trick a bank into releasing multimillion-dollar early payments. Similarly, they might "double-factor" the same invoice at two different banks. Verified hashes bind the **Invoice ID, Approved Amount, and Payment Date** to the funding bank's or the buyer's domain (e.g., `citidirect.com` or `hsbc.com`).

## Data Verified

Batch ID, funding bank name, buyer name, supplier name, itemized invoice numbers, gross invoice amounts, early payment date, maturity date (when buyer pays), discount rate (APR/Fees), net payout amount, bank officer ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Approval Advice:** Proving the buyer has "Ok'd" the invoices for payment.
- **Supplier Financing Agreement:** The overarching legal framework.
- **Assignment of Proceeds:** (Linked hash) moving the legal debt to the bank.
- **Payoff Letter:** Proof that the buyer has settled the debt with the bank.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`citi.com`, `jpmorgan.com`, `taulia.com`) and the financing standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Funded / Paid** — Cash has been disbursed to the supplier.
- **Approved / Pending** — Buyer has verified the goods; bank is awaiting drawdown.
- **Matured / Settled** — **ALERT:** The buyer has already paid the bank; this paper is historic.
- **In Dispute** — **CRITICAL:** The buyer has flagged the invoices for "Quality Issues."

## Second-Party Use

The **Supplier (The Payee)** benefits from verification.

**Working Capital Speed:** When negotiating a "Material Purchase" from a raw-goods vendor (e.g., steel or plastic), the supplier shows the verified "Citi Approval" hash. The vendor can instantly see **"VERIFIED: $1.25M"** from a top-tier bank, giving them the confidence to ship materials on credit because they know the supplier's cash is coming in 48 hours.

**Audit Compliance:** Proving to their own shareholders and auditors that their "Factored Income" is based on legitimate, buyer-approved invoices, removing the risk of "Revenue Padding" accusations.

## Third-Party Use

**Bank Auditors / Regulators**
**Systemic Risk Audit:** Verifying that the bank's "Trade Finance" portfolio is backed by authentic, buyer-verified assets. Live Verify ensures the bank isn't funding "Phantom Invoices" created by a collusive supplier and employee.

**Credit Rating Agencies (Moody's / S&P)**
**Liquidity Analysis:** Verifying the "Financing Pipeline" of a corporate buyer to ensure their "Accounts Payable" are accurately reported and haven't been hidden using off-balance-sheet factoring.

**Secondary Debt Investors**
**Portfolio Due Diligence:** Before buying a "Slice" of a bank's supply chain debt, the investor scans random hashes. Verification ensures the maturity dates and amounts match the original digital approvals.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Invoice" Fraud Problem**

- **Double-Financing:** Selling the same verified invoice to Citi and then secretly trying to sell it to HSBC.
- **Amount Inflation:** Editing an approved "$100,000" advice to read "$1,000,000" to get a larger advance.
- **Return Hiding:** Getting paid early for an invoice but then secretly accepting a "Goods Return" from the buyer, leaving the bank with worthless collateral.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Transaction Banks.**
**Supply Chain Finance Platforms (e.g., Taulia, Greensill-successors).**
**Corporate Treasury Portals.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Corporate trade volumes and supplier lists are extremely sensitive "Trade Secrets." The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized financial institutions.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Supply chain finance providers issue reverse factoring approvals and are regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

```
✓ scf.greensill.com/verify — Supply chain finance platform issuing early payment approvals
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK trade finance providers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Supply Chain Finance is the "Oil" of global manufacturing. By turning approval advice into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the banks from multi-billion dollar fraud and ensure that capital flows to legitimate suppliers with cryptographic certainty.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the bank's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (batch ID, invoice numbers, payment dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the approval advice and an audit trail regulators can inspect.
