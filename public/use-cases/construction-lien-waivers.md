## What is a Lien Waiver?

In the construction world, workers have a "Super-Power" called a **Mechanic's Lien**. If a plumber doesn't get paid, they can file a claim against the *house itself*, preventing the owner from selling it until the bill is settled.

A **Lien Waiver** is the "Receipt of Safety." It's the paper the plumber signs saying: "I have been paid $42,500, and I hereby give up my right to sue the house."

Banks won't release construction loans without these papers. Fraud is common: contractors sometimes "reuse" an old waiver or edit the date to trick the bank into releasing cash before the workers are actually paid. Verified waivers stop this multimillion-dollar shell game.

## Data Verified

Claimant (Subcontractor), Customer (GC), Job address, Payment amount (numerical/text), "Through Date" (liability cutoff), Waiver type (Conditional/Unconditional), payment reference (Check/Wire #), signatory authority.

**Document Types:**
- **Conditional Progress Waiver:** Submitted with the invoice.
- **Unconditional Progress Waiver:** Proving the cash hit the bank.
- **Final Waiver & Release:** Relinquishing all remaining lien rights upon final payment.
- **Supplier Lien Waiver:** For material-only vendors.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Subcontractor or their Payment Platform) and status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Waiver matches the claimant's accounting records.
- **Payment Cleared** — Unconditional status confirmed by bank sync.
- **Disputed** — Claimant has reported a bounced check or payment error.
- **Void** — Replaced by a corrected waiver.

## Second-Party Use

The **General Contractor (GC)** benefits from verification.

**Draw Management:** GCs manage hundreds of waivers per month. Live Verify allows them to verify the *content* of the waivers (amounts/dates) against the digital record provided by the sub, preventing the "Photoshop Date Slide" where a sub re-uses an old waiver to get a new check.

**Risk Mitigation:** Ensuring that Tier-2 suppliers (who the GC doesn't know) have actually been paid by the sub-contractors, preventing a "Surprise Lien" from a supplier later.

## Third-Party Use

**Title Insurance Companies**
**Closing Clearance:** Title officers verify every waiver in the project file before insuring a property sale or refinance. Verification prevents "Mechanics Lien Priority" disputes that can cost millions.

**Construction Lenders (Banks)**
**Funding Authorization:** Banks release "Loan Draws" based on waivers. Verified waivers provide the bank with cryptographic proof that the loan funds are flowing correctly to the workers and not being diverted.

**Property Owners**
**Lien Defense:** Proving in court that a subcontractor was paid in full, using an immutable audit trail of verified releases.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Lien Fraud" Problem**

- **Conditional Swapping:** A sub altering a "Conditional" waiver to look "Unconditional" to trick an owner into thinking the bill is settled.
- **Date Alteration:** Editing the "Through Date" from April to May to hide 30 days of unpaid liability.
- **Signature Forgery:** GCs forging sub-contractor waivers to keep the bank draws moving during a cash crunch.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Subcontractors:** (Using their own domain).
**Payment Platforms:** (e.g., Procore, Textura, Oracle Aconex).
**Accounting Software:** (e.g., QuickBooks, Sage).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Contractors issue lien waivers to document their release of mechanic's lien rights on construction projects. Self-authorized by their position as entitled lienholders under construction law.

```
✓ lien.example-contractor.com/verify — Issues construction lien waivers and release documents
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the claimant's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (project name and ID, claimant name, payment amount, period covered, waiver date) — never details of disputes or partial payments — providing non-repudiation of the lien waiver and an audit trail for banks and title companies.


## Competition vs. Payment Portals (Textura)

| Feature | Live Verify | Textura / Procore Pay | Paper / Email PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any bank or buyer can verify. | **Siloed.** Requires all parties to pay for the same platform. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Payee. | **Platform-Bound.** Trust the vendor. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** PDFs stay verifiable across systems. | **Low.** Hard to export "Trust" to a different system. | **Manual.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Minimal infrastructure. | **High.** Fees often 0.2% of contract value. | **None.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Data Room" problem. In a property sale, the buyer's lawyer needs to verify the last 3 years of construction waivers. They don't have access to the seller's private Procore portal. Live Verify provides **Portable Trust** that travels with the PDF into the data room and survives long after the project software has been deactivated.
