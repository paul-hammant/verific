## What is a Pest Control License?

If you hire someone to spray chemicals in your kitchen or drill into your foundation for termites, they must be a **Licensed Pest Control Operator (PCO)**. But at the door, the real question is narrower than "is this person in the trade?" It is:

- is this the company I booked?
- is this the technician actually assigned to my property now?
- does their license category cover the specific treatment they are proposing?

That makes pest control a threshold-decision case as much as a professional-license case.

The problem is that "Pest Control" is a high-trust, high-risk trade. Criminals pose as "inspectors" to gain entry for burglary, or unlicensed workers use "homemade" poisons that can kill pets or sicken families. Physical badges are easily forged with a home printer. Live Verify allows a resident or restaurant manager to scan the technician's ID to verify: **"Is this the right technician from the right firm, currently authorized for this visit and this treatment category?"**

## Data Verified

License number, licensee full name, photograph (via hash), company name (DBA), assignment or work-order reference where applicable, license categories (e.g., Structural, Lawn, Termite), expiration date, background check timestamp, insurance policy ID, issuing state board.

**Document Types:**
- **PCO Pocket ID:** The primary field identification.
- **Application Certificate:** (Linked hash) for industrial/commercial sites.
- **Pesticide Application Log:** (Linked hash) documenting specific chemicals used.
- **WDI (Wood Destroying Insect) Report:** For real estate closings.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`texasag.gov`, `fdacs.gov`, `agriculture.ny.gov`) and the professional status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Clear** — License is valid and the technician is in good standing for the claimed service.
- **Suspended** — **CRITICAL:** Practice authority is temporarily revoked (e.g., due to safety violation).
- **Insurance Lapsed** — **ALERT:** The technician is not currently covered by a bond.
- **Restricted** — **ALERT:** Technician is not authorized for certain categories (e.g., "No Termites").
- **WRONG_COMPANY** — The person may be real, but not from the firm the customer expected.
- **NOT_ASSIGNED** — The person may be licensed, but is not the technician assigned for this visit.
- **OUT_OF_SCOPE** — The technician or firm is real, but not authorized for the claimed treatment class or chemical use.

## Second-Party Use

The **Technician (Practitioner)** benefits from verification.

**Customer Trust Speed:** When arriving at a late-night emergency call (e.g., for a bed bug outbreak), the tech can proactively show a credential that confirms both licensure and company assignment. That lets the resident decide quickly without a long phone call or a risky guess.

**Bid Credibility:** A small business owner can include verified license hashes in their service contracts. This proves to property managers that their crew is 100% licensed and background-checked, distinguishing them from "un-insured cash" competitors.

## Third-Party Use

**Homeowners / Restaurant Managers**
**Public Health Safety:** Before allowing someone to spray chemicals near food prep areas, a manager scans the badge. Verification ensures the tech isn't using a borrowed license number, arriving under the wrong company name, or claiming a treatment category they are not authorized to perform.

**Real Estate Agents / Title Companies**
**Closing Integrity:** Verifying that the "Termite Clearance" (WDI) report was actually signed by a licensed professional and isn't a "Photoshop forgery" designed to hide a $10,000 structural issue from a buyer.

**Chemical Wholesalers**
**Access Control:** Verifying the license hash before selling restricted-use pesticides (RUPs) to a customer, ensuring they aren't selling dangerous poisons to un-trained individuals.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Uniform" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Spoofing:** Scammers using a real company's logo and a fake ID badge to "inspect" homes for burglary.
- **Company Substitution:** Customer books one firm, but a cheaper or unknown subcontractor shows up instead.
- **Visit Misassignment:** Real technician, wrong property or wrong day.
- **Category Padding:** Editing a PDF to add "Termite" authority to a license that only allows "Ant/Roach" spraying.
- **Revocation Hiding:** Continuing to practice using a physical "Valid" card after the board revoked the license for poisoning a client's pet.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Departments of Agriculture.**
**Environmental Quality Bureaus.**
**National Pest Management Registries.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Technician names and home addresses are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Mass Roster Scraping" by predatory marketers or data brokers.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated / commercial

The strongest version is layered: the board or regulator confirms standing and treatment scope; the company or dispatch system confirms that this is the right technician for this address and visit.

```
✓ bpca.org.uk/member/verify — Maintains register of qualified pest control operators
  ✓ hse.gov.uk — Regulates UK workplace health and safety
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Pest control is a "toxic trust" domain. The risk is not abstract credential inflation; it is letting the wrong person into a home or food-prep area to use dangerous chemicals. The strongest Live Verify version therefore combines live license scope with current company identity and visit legitimacy.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion
