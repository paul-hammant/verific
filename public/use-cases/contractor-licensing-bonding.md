## What is a Contractor License?

In most states, a "General Contractor" isn't just someone with a truck and a hammer. They are a licensed professional who has:
1.  **Passed a Board Exam:** Proving they know building codes and laws.
2.  **Obtained a Surety Bond:** A $25,000+ "Insurance" fund that protects the homeowner if the contractor abandons the job.
3.  **Passed a Criminal Background Check.**

Homeowners use these "Pocket Cards" to verify who they are letting onto their roof or into their basement. Verified licenses ensure the person at the door isn't using a "Borrowed" license from a friend or a fake number from a defunct company.

**Why would you bother verifying?** Because when an unlicensed contractor abandons a half-finished job, the homeowner has no surety bond to claim against, no licensing board to complain to, and no practical legal recourse — the contractor often operates through a shell company that dissolves overnight. Worse, work performed by an unlicensed contractor may not pass building inspection, requiring the homeowner to pay a second contractor to tear it out and redo it. Insurance claims for property damage caused by unlicensed work are routinely denied. The $5,000 the homeowner "saved" by hiring someone cheaper becomes a $30,000 loss.

## Data Verified

Business name, qualifying individual, license number, classification (e.g., General Building, Electrical, Plumbing), bond amount, surety company ID, expiration date, workers' comp status, disciplinary flags.

**Document Types:**
- **Wall Certificate:** The formal license displayed in the office.
- **Pocket Card:** Carried by the contractor in the field.
- **Verification of Licensure:** Official extract for large project bids.
- **Bond Rider:** Proving specific project bonding.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — License is valid and bond is in force
- **SUSPENDED** — Temporary restriction (e.g., due to lapsed insurance); do not hire
- **REVOKED** — Permanently barred from contracting; do not hire
- **INACTIVE** — Contractor is not currently authorized to perform work
- **404** — License not found (fake number, wrong state, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the certificate itself (e.g., `cslb.ca.gov`).

## Post-Verification Actions

None typically. The verification confirms license and bond status; that's the decision point for hiring.

**Why No Further Action:**

- **Homeowners** just need status before signing a contract
- **Building departments** just need confirmation before issuing permits
- **Supply houses** just need verification for trade pricing access

The status code is the value. If it's OK, proceed. If it's SUSPENDED, REVOKED, INACTIVE, or 404, find another contractor. No POST form needed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Contractor** benefits from verification.

**Customer Confidence:** Proving to a homeowner at the kitchen table that the "Active License" claim is verified by the state. This separates the professional from the "Truck and a Ladder" unlicensed operators who undercut on price but carry no insurance.

**Permit Pulling:** Speeding up the building permit process. Most city building departments require proof of license. A verified hash allows the clerk to skip the manual state database search.

## Third-Party Use

**Homeowners / Commercial Clients**
**Due Diligence:** Before signing a $50,000 contract, a client scans the contractor's pocket card. "Verified by State Board" confirms the contractor is actually the person on the card and has an active $25,000 surety bond.

**Building Inspectors**
**Field Enforcement:** Checking credentials of crews on a job-site to ensure they aren't "License Borrowing" from a different company.

**Supply Houses (Wholesale)**
**Trade Discounts:** Ensuring that only licensed professionals are accessing contractor-only pricing for materials.

## Verification Architecture

**The "License Borrowing" Fraud Problem**

- **Renting a License:** An unlicensed person paying a retired contractor to use their number on a permit. Verification shows the "Principal Name" which won't match the person at the door.
- **Bond Concealment:** Pretending a bond is active when it was cancelled for non-payment months ago.
- **Classification Fraud:** A "Landscaper" (low risk) claiming to be a "General Contractor" (high risk) to take on a house-flip project they aren't qualified for.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Licensing Boards:** (e.g., California CSLB, Texas TDLR).
**Municipal Licensing:** (In states without centralized boards).
**Surety Companies:** (For the bonding component).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

State licensing boards issue contractor licenses and bonding to protect consumers.

```
✓ cslb.ca.gov — Issues California contractor licenses
  ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the licensing authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (license number, classification, issue date, expiration date, bond amount, surety company) — never personal details, disciplinary history details, or criminal records — providing non-repudiation of the license issuance.


## Competition vs. State Search Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | State Website Search | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Identity.** Proves *Who* is licensed. | **Vague.** Hard to prove the person in front of you is the person in the DB. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Type in license #, navigate mobile-unfriendly site. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Board. | **High.** But prone to "typo" errors. | **Medium.** |
| **Field Use** | **High.** Mobile-optimized workflow. | **Low.** Hard to use on a construction site. | **Universal.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Kitchen Table" workflow. Homeowners are notoriously bad at verifying contractors. Live Verify turns the **Physical Pocket Card** into a live, high-speed trust tool that works in the driveway or kitchen, where the hiring decision is actually made.
