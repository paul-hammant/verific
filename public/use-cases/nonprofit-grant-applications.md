## What is a Grant Award Letter?

A **Grant Award Letter** is the official notification from a foundation or government agency that a non-profit has won funding. It details:
1.  **Amount:** The specific sum awarded.
2.  **Purpose:** Restricted use (e.g., "For the Literacy Program only").
3.  **Conditions:** Reporting requirements.

This letter is the "proof of income" for non-profits. They show it to other donors ("See, Ford Foundation supports us!") and to banks to get bridge loans before the cash arrives.

## Data Verified

Recipient organization, grant amount, grant purpose (restricted vs. unrestricted), award date, authorized signatory.

**Document Types:**
- **Award Letter:** The "Happy News" document.
- **Grant Agreement:** The full contract signed by both parties.
- **Disbursement Notice:** Proof that funds were sent.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Foundation) and the status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Awarded** — Active grant.
- **Paid** — Funds have been fully disbursed.
- **Rescinded** — Grant cancelled (e.g., due to non-compliance).

## Second-Party Use

The **Non-Profit (Grantee)** benefits heavily.
- **Bridge Financing:** Banks often lend money against "receivables." A verified Award Letter is rock-solid proof of a receivable, allowing the non-profit to start work before the check clears.
- **Matching Grants:** "We have $500k from Foundation A, will you match it?" Foundation B can verify the claim instantly without calling Foundation A.

## Third-Party Use

**Auditors (IRS / Independent)**
**Compliance:** Auditors check if restricted funds were used correctly. Verifying the original letter ensures the auditor knows exactly what restrictions were placed on the money.

**Media / Watchdogs**
**Transparency:** If a non-profit claims "Supported by the Gates Foundation," journalists can verify the claim directly from the document.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Funding" Fraud Problem**
- **Inflated Assets:** Non-profits struggling with cash flow might forge award letters to secure loans or stave off insolvency.
- **Prestige Fraud:** Claiming support from prestigious foundations to lure smaller donors.
- **Diverted Funds:** A corrupt director altering the "Purpose" line from "Restricted to building repair" to "General Operating Support" to justify spending it on salaries.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)
- **Private Foundations:** (Ford, Rockefeller, Gates).
- **Government Agencies:** (NIH, NEA, local arts councils).
- **Corporate Giving Programs:** (Google.org, Target Foundation).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Grant-giving agencies approve and document lottery funding for nonprofit organizations.

```
✓ grants.lottery.culture.gov.uk/verify — Issues national lottery grant awards
  ✓ charitycommission.gov.uk — Regulates charities in England and Wales
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the foundation's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (recipient organization, grant amount, award date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the grant award letter and an audit trail charity regulators can inspect.

## Competition vs. Email / Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | Grant Portals (Fluxx/SmartSimple) | Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shareability** | **High.** Send the PDF to anyone (bank, donor). | **Low.** Login required. Hard to share access with a bank. | **Medium.** Can forward, but easy to fake. |
| **Permanence** | **High.** Independent of portal access. | **Medium.** What if you lose your login? | **Medium.** Buried in inboxes. |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Mathematical certainty. | **Siloed.** Trust depends on portal security. | **Zero.** Easily spoofed. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:**
Grant portals are great for *managing* the application, but terrible for *sharing* the success. You can't give your banker a login to your Fluxx portal. You *can* give them a verified PDF Award Letter.
