## What is a Regulatory Compliance Attestation?

A regulatory compliance attestation confirms that an entity has met specific regulatory requirements at a point in time. Unlike filing receipts (which prove submission), attestations prove that the authority has reviewed and confirmed compliance. These include inspection passes, audit clearances, and regulatory approvals.

Compliance attestation fraud is serious: fake inspection certificates can enable dangerous operations, and forged audit clearances can hide financial misconduct.

## Data Verified

Regulatory authority, entity name, site/facility identifier, inspection/audit date, result (pass/fail/conditional), scope of compliance, validity period, inspector/auditor identification.

**Document Types:**
- **Inspection Certificate:** Physical site inspection passed.
- **Audit Attestation:** Financial or operational audit completed.
- **Registration Confirmation:** Entity registered with regulator.
- **Compliance Certification:** Third-party compliance verification.
- **License Good Standing:** Regulatory license in good standing.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`osha.gov`, `fda.gov`, industry certification body) and compliance status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Compliant** — All requirements met.
- **Conditional** — Compliance with conditions or corrective action required.
- **Under Review** — Compliance status being reassessed.
- **Suspended** — Compliance suspended pending investigation.
- **Revoked** — Compliance certification withdrawn.

## Second-Party Use

The **Regulated Entity** benefits from verification.

**Customer Assurance:** Companies can prove regulatory compliance to customers concerned about safety, security, or environmental standards.

**Contract Qualification:** Many contracts require proof of regulatory compliance. Verified attestations satisfy these requirements.

**Insurance Coverage:** Some policies require regulatory compliance for coverage. Verified attestations prove eligibility.

**M&A Due Diligence:** When selling a business, verified compliance history supports valuation.

## Third-Party Use

**Customers / Clients**
**Vendor Qualification:** Before engaging vendors, companies verify regulatory compliance status.

**Insurance Underwriters**
**Risk Assessment:** Compliance history affects insurance rates and eligibility.

**Banks / Lenders**
**Loan Covenants:** Loan agreements often require regulatory compliance. Verified attestations prove covenant compliance.

**Supply Chain Partners**
**Qualification:** Manufacturers verify supplier compliance with relevant regulations (FDA, EPA, OSHA).

**Government Contractors**
**Subcontractor Verification:** Prime contractors verify subcontractor compliance with federal regulations.

## Verification Architecture

**The Compliance Attestation Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Certifications:** Forged compliance certificates from real or invented bodies.
- **Expired Certificates:** Presenting outdated compliance as current.
- **Scope Misrepresentation:** Claiming broader compliance than was actually certified.
- **Self-Certification Fraud:** False self-attestations on required compliance forms.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Federal Regulators:** (OSHA, FDA, EPA, FTC, SEC) federal compliance.
**State Regulators:** State licensing and compliance authorities.
**Industry Bodies:** (PCI SSC, ISO registrars) industry standard compliance.
**Accredited Auditors:** Third-party compliance auditors.
**International:** (EMA, GDPR authorities) foreign regulatory bodies.

**Continuous Compliance**

Some regulations require ongoing compliance, not just point-in-time. Verified attestations should indicate whether compliance is current or historical.

**Conditional Compliance**

Many compliance determinations come with conditions or corrective action requirements. Verified attestations should indicate any conditions attached to the compliance status.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Regulatory authorities and agencies hold statutory power to issue compliance attestations, audit clearances, and inspection certificates.

```
✓ fca.org.uk/compliance/verify — Issues regulatory compliance attestations and certifications
```

Self-authorized — this is a sovereign body whose authority derives from statute.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the regulatory authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (entity name, inspection/audit date, result, validity period) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the compliance attestation and an audit trail regulators can inspect.
