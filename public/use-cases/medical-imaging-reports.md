## Data Verified

Patient name, MRN/Accession number, study type (e.g., MRI, CT), anatomical region, radiologist "Impression" (digest), clinical indication, study date, report date, radiologist credentials, facility ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Radiology Report:** The text narrative of findings.
- **DICOM Image Metadata:** (Linked hash) proving the images match the text.
- **Peer Review Letter:** Verification of a second radiologist's opinion.
- **PACS Archive Receipt:** Proving the study is legally stored.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`radpartners.com`, `mayoclinic.org`) and current report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Report is verified and signed by the radiologist.
- **Addendum** — **ALERT:** A post-signing correction or update was issued.
- **Preliminary** — Unsigned draft; do not base surgery on this version.
- **Void** — Study performed on wrong patient or technically flawed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient** benefits from verification.

**Specialist Consultation:** Proving to a neurosurgeon at a different hospital that the "4mm cyst" finding isn't a misprint. A verified hash from the radiology group provides the surgeon with instant trust, allowing them to proceed with a treatment plan without waiting for a 2-week manual records transfer.

**Insurance Appeals:** Providing verified, un-alterable evidence of a diagnostic finding to challenge an insurance denial for a follow-up procedure.

## Third-Party Use

**Referring Physicians (PCPs)**
**Diagnostic Trust:** PCPs often receive paper or PDF reports from outside imaging centers. Live Verify ensures the patient hasn't "Self-Edited" the report to remove a mention of cancer or to hide an embarrassing finding before showing it to their family doctor.

**Life & Long-Term Care Insurers**
**Risk Underwriting:** Verifying the "Impression" section of a brain MRI or heart CT before issuing high-value policies. Verification stops the most common "Medical Fraud": removing a single sentence about a pre-existing condition.

**Disability Adjusters**
**Claim Adjudication:** Verifying the structural findings (e.g., "Degenerative Disc Disease") used to justify a long-term disability claim.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Medical Denial" Fraud Problem**

- **Negative-to-Positive Editing:** A patient who wants to stay on disability editing a "Normal" MRI to show a "Herniated Disc."
- **Positive-to-Negative Editing:** A pilot or athlete editing a "Cardiac Abnormality" report to "Normal" to pass a physical.
- **Radiologist Impersonation:** Creating a fake report on the letterhead of a famous imaging center to justify an unauthorized surgery or treatment.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Radiology Groups:** (National or local imaging centers).
**Hospital Systems.**
**PACS Vendors:** (e.g., GE Healthcare, Fuji - who host the hashes on behalf of doctors).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Imaging reports contain highly sensitive clinical data. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Mapping" of patients with specific neurological or cardiac conditions.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Radiology departments issue medical imaging reports under health professional regulator authority (HCPC in the UK).

```
✓ radiology.nhs.uk/imaging/verify — Issues medical imaging reports
  ✓ hcpc-uk.org — Regulates health and care professionals in the UK
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the radiology group's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (patient accession numbers, study types, radiologist names, study dates, report status) — never sensitive clinical details — providing non-repudiation of the imaging report.


## Competition vs. Patient Portals / CD-ROMs

| Feature | Live Verify | Patient Portal (MyChart) | CD-ROM / PACS Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Control** | **High.** Patient shares only the *Summary*. | **Low.** App access often reveals *full* clinical history. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lab. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged files. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any specialist. | **Siloed.** Hard to share across systems. | **Hardware-Locked.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires 2FA and login. | **Very Slow.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Clinical Handoff." Specialists often work in offices separate from where the scan was taken. They meet patients who bring paper reports. They don't have time to log into 10 different hospital portals. Live Verify turns the **Physical Radiology Report** into a live, trusted clinical link that provides "Radiology-Grade" trust in seconds.
