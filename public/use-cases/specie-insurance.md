## What is Specie Insurance?

In the world of high-value logistics, **Specie Insurance** covers the transport and storage of "portable wealth"—specifically **Fine Art**, **Diamonds/Jewels**, and **Gold Bullion**. These policies are "All-Risk" and often cover a single transit event (e.g., moving a Van Gogh from London to New York) worth $50 million or more.

These documents are the "Proof of Protection" for the most valuable items on Earth. Fraud is high-stakes: a courier might create a fake "Lloyd's" certificate to trick a museum into releasing a painting, or an owner might "edit" a policy to hide a "No-Armored-Car" exclusion after a theft. Verified hashes bind the **Item Description, Transit Route, and Security Protocols** to the specialist insurer's domain (e.g., `lloyds.com` or `axa-art.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, insurer name, insured name, itemized asset list (with serials/ID), total insured value, transit route (Origin/Destination), approved carrier name, security protocol level (e.g., Armored), storage requirements, effective date, expiration date, broker ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Specie Transit Certificate:** For individual high-value moves.
- **Vault Insurance Summary:** For long-term bullion storage.
- **Evidence of Fine Art Insurance:** Provided to museums and galleries.
- **Armored Courier Manifest:** (Linked hash) for the physical handoff.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`axa-art.com`, `hisicox.com`, `lloyds.com`) and the policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Bound** — Coverage is in force for the stated transit.
- **Protocol Mismatch** — **ALERT:** The security requirements on the paper don't match the insurer's record.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** The transit window has passed; asset is un-insured.
- **Claim Active** — **ALERT:** A loss or damage event has been reported for this asset.

## Second-Party Use

The **Collector / Museum Director** benefits from verification.

**Loan Approval Speed:** Before a gallery releases a $10M painting for an exhibition, they scan the borrower's insurance hash. "Verified by AXA Art" gives the gallery the cryptographic proof needed to release the asset, removing the 48-hour "Broker Call" delay.

**Buyer Confidence:** In a private sale of a high-end watch or diamond, the seller shows the verified insurance hash. This proves to the buyer that the item was recently valued and insured by a top-tier firm, acting as a "Secondary Appraisal."

## Third-Party Use

**Armored Carriers (Brinks / Malca-Amit)**
**Liability Vetting:** Before picking up a crate of gold, the courier scans the verified insurance hash. This ensures that the insurer has "Authorized" the specific carrier and route, protecting the courier from being held liable for a loss that the insurer might otherwise deny.

**Auction Houses (Sotheby's / Christie's)**
**Consignment Audit:** Verifying that incoming high-value items were continuously insured during transit to the auction house, maintaining the "Chain of Value."

**Customs & Port Security**
**High-Value Vetting:** Verifying the declared value of "Diplomatic Pouches" or armored crates by scanning the accompanying insurance hashes, preventing "Under-Declaration" of duty-heavy jewels.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Vanishing Van Gogh" Fraud Problem**

- **Security Downgrading:** Editing a PDF to remove a "GPS Tracking" requirement so the owner can use a cheaper, un-tracked van.
- **Value Padding:** Changing a $5M insured value to $50M before a planned "Theft" to scam the insurer.
- **Carrier Spoofing:** Creating a fake policy from a non-existent "Premium Art Insurer" to steal a consignment.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Fine Art & Specie Insurers.**
**Lloyd's of London Marine Syndicates.**
**High-Security Logistics Portals.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. High-value asset locations and routes are the most sensitive data in the world. The hash must be salted and access restricted to pre-authorized logistics IPs.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Lloyd's of London issues specie and fine art insurance policies and is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance framework.

```
✓ specie.lloyds.com/verify — Lloyd's syndicate specializing in fine art and specie insurance
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Specie insurance is the "Trust of the Treasure." By turning specialty certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the world's heritage and wealth from the high-stakes risk of documentary deception.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive specie insurers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, insurer name, insured name, itemized asset list with serials/ID, total insured value, transit route, approved carrier name, security protocol level, storage requirements, effective date, expiration date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the specie insurance policy.
