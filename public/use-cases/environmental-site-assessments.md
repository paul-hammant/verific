## What is a Phase I ESA?

Before a bank will give a $10 million loan for a commercial building, they need a "Medical Exam" for the land. This is called a **Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)**.

An expert looks at old maps and walks the site to see if it was ever a gas station, a dry cleaner, or a chemical dump. If they find a "REC" (Recognized Environmental Condition), the property might be worth zero.

Fraud happens when a seller "Deletes" the page of the report that mentions a buried oil tank to trick a bank into approving a loan. Verified hashes protect the **expert's actual findings**, ensuring the bank isn't lending on a toxic liability.

## Data Verified

Property address, assessment type (Phase I/II), ASTM standard version, primary findings (e.g., "No RECs identified"), lead assessor name/license, client name, report date, report ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Phase I ESA:** Desktop review and site walk (no sampling).
- **Phase II ESA:** Subsurface sampling and lab results.
- **Vapor Intrusion Report:** Specific to indoor air safety.
- **Reliance Letter:** Allowing a bank to rely on an old report.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Environmental Consulting Firm) and current report status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Report matches the firm's official record.
- **Amended** — A revised report exists (e.g., after finding a data gap).
- **Stale** — **ALERT:** Report is > 180 days old; no longer valid for AAI protection.
- **Void** — Report retracted due to technical error.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Seller / Owner** benefits from verification.

**M&A Transactions:** Proving to a multimillion-dollar buyer that the "Clean Phase I" isn't a fake PDF created to hide a massive toxic leak. A verified hash allows the buyer to close the deal weeks faster by bypassing manual consultant calls.

**Refinancing:** Providing verified proof of environmental due diligence to a bank's risk department to unlock a lower interest rate on a commercial mortgage.

## Third-Party Use

**Commercial Lenders (Banks)**
**Collateral Vetting:** Environmental cleanup costs (CERCLA) can exceed the value of the land. Lenders verify the "No RECs" claim to protect their collateral. Live Verify ensures the borrower hasn't "Deleted" the page mentioning a buried oil tank.

**Environmental Regulators**
**Enforcement:** Verifying the authenticity of site assessments submitted during brownfield redevelopment grant applications.

**Investors / Shareholders**
**ESG Transparency:** Ensuring that corporate "Environmental Risk" disclosures in annual reports are backed by verified, un-altered expert assessments.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Clean" Fraud Problem**

- **REC Deletion:** Removing the page from a PDF report that mentions a "Recognized Environmental Condition" (e.g., a former gas station on the site).
- **Date Stretching:** Changing a 2020 report date to 2026 to hide that the data is 6 years out of date.
- **Consultant Impersonation:** Forging a report on the letterhead of a reputable firm like ERM or Tetra Tech.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Environmental Consultants:** (e.g., ERM, Stantec, Arcadis).
**Accredited Laboratories:** (Handling the Phase II soil/water samples).
**Insurance Carriers:** (Who underwrite the pollution liability).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Environmental consultants are accredited to conduct phase I and phase II site assessments.

```
✓ esa.example-environmental.com — Conducts environmental site assessments
  ✓ iema.net — Accredits UK environmental impact assessors
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the environmental consultant's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (property addresses, assessment types, ASTM standards, primary findings, lead assessor names and licenses, report dates) — never detailed remediation costs or liability exposure details — providing non-repudiation of the assessment and an audit trail environmental regulators and lenders can inspect.

## Competition vs. Environmental Data Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | EDR / Environmental Data Portals | Scanned PDF Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Consultant. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the database aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Findings.** Protects the text. | **Vague.** Doesn't verify the *Expert Opinion* text. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Legal Weight** | **High.** Proves the expert's attestation. | **Low.** Just a search of public records. | **High.** But untrusted. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the report. | **Slow.** Requires subscription and manual search. | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Expert Opinion" gap. EDR portals can tell you where the nearby gas stations are. But only an ESA Report tells you what the **Expert thinks** about the risk. Live Verify turns that high-stakes expert opinion into a verifiable digital anchor that cannot be tampered with during a property flip.
