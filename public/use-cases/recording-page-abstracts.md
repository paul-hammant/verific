## What is a Recording Page Abstract?

A **Recording Page Abstract** (often the "First Page" or "Stamp Page") is the formal proof that a legal document—like a **Deed**, **Mortgage**, or **Lien**—has been officially filed in the public land records. It contains the "Instrument Number" and the "Book & Page" reference that makes the document a matter of public notice.

These pages are the "Lifeblood of Title." Fraud is high-stakes: criminals create "Phantom Deeds" by using high-end printers to place a fake county recording stamp on a forged property transfer. They then use these "verified" papers to steal a home's equity or to sell a house they don't own. Verified hashes bind the **Instrument Number, Grantor/Grantee Names, and Timestamp** to the county recorder's domain (e.g., `cookcountyclerk.com` or `maricopa.gov`).

## Data Verified

Instrument number, book/page reference, recording date and precise time, document type (e.g., Quitclaim Deed, Release of Mortgage), grantor name, grantee name, parcel ID (PIN), legal description snippet, county clerk ID, recording fee paid.

**Document Types:**
- **Recording Abstract Page:** The stamped cover sheet.
- **Deed of Trust:** (Linked hash) the primary loan security.
- **Satisfaction of Mortgage:** Proof that a lien is cleared.
- **Notice of Lis Pendens:** (Linked hash) warning of active litigation.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cookcountyclerk.com`, `maricopa.gov`, `clerk.org`) and the record standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified / Recorded** — Document is an authentic part of the public land record.
- **Rescinded** — **ALERT:** A subsequent document has legally voided this record.
- **Pending Indexing** — Recorded but not yet fully categorized in the search system.
- **Fraud Flag** — **CRITICAL:** This instrument number has been flagged for investigation by the Sheriff.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner (Grantee)** benefits from verification.

**Equity Theft Protection:** An owner can periodically scan the "Last Recorded Deed" hash for their home. If the hash returns **"SUPERSEDED"** or shows a **"NEW LIEN"** they didn't authorize, they have early warning of deed fraud and can contact the authorities before the property is sold or mortgaged by a criminal.

**Loan Refinancing:** Proving to a new lender that a "Mortgage Release" from a previous bank was actually recorded. Verified hashes bypass the 2-week "Title Search" delay, potentially closing the new loan faster.

## Third-Party Use

**Title Examiners / Abstractors**
**Rapid Due Diligence:** Instead of waiting for a manual update from the county's legacy database, an examiner can scan the verified hash on a "Release of Lien" provided by the seller. "Verified by Cook County" provides the proof needed to clear a title requirement instantly.

**Real Estate Attorneys**
**Evidence Authentication:** In a dispute over "Priority of Liens," the attorney verifies the hashes to prove which document was stamped first, down to the exact second.

**Lenders and Underwriters**
**Closing Audit:** Verifying that the deed they just funded was actually recorded and hasn't been "intercepted" or altered before reaching the county vault.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Deed" Fraud Problem**

- **Stamp Forgery:** Using a realistic-looking "County Recorded" rubber stamp on a fake deed.
- **Indexing Hiding:** Hiding a "Notice of Default" by placing it deep within a multi-page PDF that has a "Clean" abstract page.
- **Serial Swapping:** Using one legitimate instrument number to cover for a fake document.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**County Recorders / Registrars of Deeds.**
**Electronic Recording (e-Recording) Gateways.**
**Land Registry Portals.**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. While land records are public, the ability to "Mass-Harvest" property transfers is a target for predatory data brokers. The hash must be salted to prevent unauthorized bulk scraping.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Records and administers property deed and land title records.

```
✓ recorder.county.gov/abstract/verify — Records and administers property deed and land title records
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Property records are the "Physical Registry of Wealth." By turning recording stamps into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the stability of the housing market and ensure that "Ownership" is based on the digital truth of the county vault.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the county recorder's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (instrument number, recording date, document type, grantor/grantee names, page count) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the recording and public notice.
