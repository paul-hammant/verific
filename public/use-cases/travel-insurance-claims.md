## What is a Travel Insurance Settlement?

A **Travel Insurance Settlement Advice** is the formal document issued by an insurer (like Allianz, AIG, or World Nomads) confirming that a claim has been approved and paid. It itemizes the loss—whether it's a $50,000 Medical Evacuation, a $2,000 Trip Cancellation, or a $500 Baggage Delay—and shows the final amount disbursed to the traveler.

These documents are "Financial Recovery" records. Fraud is high-stakes: claimants often "edit" a settlement letter to inflate the amount paid to get a higher "Secondary Payout" from an employer or a second insurer (Double-Dipping). Similarly, scammers create fake "Settlement Notices" to trick overseas hospitals into releasing a medical lien. Verified hashes bind the **Settlement Amount, Loss Type, and Claim ID** to the insurer's domain (e.g., `allianz.com` or `aig.com`).

## Data Verified

Claim ID, policy number, claimant name, loss category (e.g., Medical, Cancellation, Baggage), date of loss, itemized payout amounts, deductible applied, net settlement value, currency, paid date, issuing claims adjuster ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Settlement Advice:** The 1-page proof of payment.
- **Explanation of Benefits (EOB):** The detailed itemization of the audit.
- **Guarantee of Payment (GOP):** (Linked hash) sent to a foreign hospital.
- **Release & Discharge:** (Linked hash) signed by the traveler.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`allianz.com`, `aig.com`, `battleface.com`) and the claim standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Settled / Paid** — Funds have been disbursed and the file is closed.
- **Approved / Pending** — Claim is verified; funds are in transit.
- **Denied** — **CRITICAL:** Claim was rejected (indicates potential fraud if paper says otherwise).
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** A corrected settlement has been issued.

## Second-Party Use

The **Traveler (Claimant)** benefits from verification.

**Tax Deduction Proof:** If a traveler's medical loss wasn't fully reimbursed, they can use the verified "Settlement Advice" to prove the "Uncovered Loss" to the IRS for a casualty deduction, removing the risk of audit rejection.

**Hospital Lien Release:** If a hospital in a foreign country is holding a traveler's passport pending payment, the traveler can show the verified "Guarantee of Payment" or "Settlement" hash. The hospital can instantly see **"VERIFIED PAYOUT"** from a global brand, allowing the traveler to leave the country.

## Third-Party Use

**Secondary Insurers (e.g., Amex / Chase)**
**Double-Dipping Audit:** Credit card insurers often provide "Secondary" coverage. Before paying a claim, they scan the "Primary" insurer's verified settlement. If the hash returns **"FULLY REIMBURSED,"** they can deny the redundant claim, protecting the insurance pool.

**Employers / HR Teams**
**Corporate Recovery:** If an employee was on a business trip, the company may be entitled to the insurance payout. Verifying the settlement ensures the employee isn't "pocketing" a refund for a trip the company paid for.

**Forensic Auditors**
**Portfolio Audit:** Verifying thousands of "Paid Claims" during an annual audit of an insurance carrier to ensure the digital truth matches the paper files.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Thai Hospital" Fraud Problem**

- **Bill Inflation:** Editing a $1,000 foreign hospital bill to look like a $10,000 bill on a PDF.
- **Ghost Claims:** Creating a fake settlement letter for a "Lost Camera" that was never actually owned or lost.
- **Refund Hiding:** Editing a cancellation settlement to hide that the airline already gave a 50% cash refund.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Travel Insurers.**
**Third-Party Administrators (TPAs).**
**Premium Credit Card Benefits Units.**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Medical loss data and payout amounts are sensitive PII. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized financial partners.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Travel insurers like Aviva issue claim settlements and are regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance and financial services framework.

```
✓ claims.aviva.co.uk/travel/verify — Travel insurance provider issuing claim settlements and payouts
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Travel insurance is the "Global Safety Net." By turning settlement letters into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the integrity of the claims process and ensure that payouts are based on the professional truth of the audit, not the creative editing of a claimant.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive insurers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (claim ID, policy number, claimant name, loss category, date of loss, itemized payout amounts, deductible applied, net settlement value, currency, paid date, issuing claims adjuster ID) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the settlement advice.
