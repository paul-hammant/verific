## What is a Customs Entry?

When a shipping container arrives in a country, the importer must file a **Customs Entry (CBP Form 7501 in the US)**. This is the official "Tax Return" for the shipment.

It proves:
1.  **What is inside:** (e.g., "Machinery Parts").
2.  **The Value:** "Worth $100,000."
3.  **The Duty:** "Paid $12,450 in tax."

Verification is critical for lenders who use "Imported Inventory" as collateral. A verified 7501 proves that the goods were legally imported and that the government doesn't have a "Senior Lien" for unpaid duties.

## Data Verified

Entry Number, Importer name, Broker ID, Entry Type (e.g., Consumption, Bonded, FTZ), Port of Entry, HS Code classification, merchandise value, duty amount paid, liquidation date, release status.

**Document Types:**
- **CBP Form 7501:** Entry Summary (The "Official" proof of duty payment).
- **Delivery Order:** Issued by broker to carrier once cleared.
- **Customs Release (Form 3461):** Preliminary release from the terminal.
- **Notification of Liquidation:** Final legal closing of the entry.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cbp.gov`, `hmrc.gov.uk`) and current entry standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Released** — Goods cleared for domestic use.
- **Liquidated** — Entry finalized; no further duty changes.
- **In-Bond** — Moving under bond; duty not yet paid.
- **Seized/Hold** — Customs has frozen the shipment.

## Second-Party Use

The **Importer** or **Customs Broker** benefits from verification.

**Payment Disputes:** Proving to a customer that the $12,450 "Duty Charge" on the invoice was actually paid to the government and isn't a "Fake Fee" added by the broker.

**Audit Readiness:** During a "Focus Assessment" (audit), the importer can provide verified digital hashes of their entries to prove 100% compliance without mailing thousands of paper 7501s to the government.

## Third-Party Use

**Lenders / Factors**
**Inventory Verification:** Verifying that "Imported Inventory" in a warehouse has actually cleared customs and all duties are paid. Unpaid duties are a "Senior Lien" that takes priority over the bank's security interest.

**Domestic Buyers**
**Resale Compliance:** A buyer of high-value machinery (e.g., an MRI machine) can verify that the unit was legally imported and all duties were settled, protecting them from future seizure by the government for "Origin/Duty Fraud."

**Supply Chain Auditors**
**Sourcing Integrity:** Verifying that a supplier isn't bypassing trade sanctions or anti-dumping duties by misclassifying goods on the entry summary.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Double Invoice" Fraud Problem**

- **Duty Evasion:** Showing a "Low Value" entry summary to Customs to save money, but showing a "High Value" one to the bank to get a bigger loan.
- **HS Code Tampering:** Editing the paper 7501 to show a "Duty-Free" code while the actual government record shows a 25% tariff was paid (or bypassed).
- **Fictitious Entry:** Creating a fake 7501 to get a "Customs Refund" or "Drawback" from the government for goods that were never actually imported.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Customs Agencies:** (U.S. CBP, U.K. HMRC, German Zoll).
**Authorized Customs Brokers.**
**Trade Platforms:** (e.g., Flexport, Expeditors).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

HMRC administers customs entry clearance and import duty collection under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.

```
✓ customs.hmrc.gov.uk/clearance/verify — HMRC customs entry and import clearance service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the customs authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (entry number, clearance date, goods value, duty amount) — never importer names, shipping routes, or commercial terms — providing non-repudiation of the customs entry issuance.


## Competition vs. ACE Portal / Single Window

| Feature | Live Verify | ACE Portal (Gov) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Gov. | **Database.** Direct access. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Accessibility** | **Open.** Any bank or buyer can verify. | **Restricted.** Requires Gov credentials and Vetting. | **Instant.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan the paper. | **Slow.** Requires login and manual entry search. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Proves the *Duty Paid* matches. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Downstream Trust" gap. Government "Single Window" portals (like ACE) are for the government and brokers. Lenders, auditors, and domestic buyers are locked out. Live Verify turns the **Official Paper Filling** into a public-facing trust bridge, allowing the private sector to leverage government data without needing a government login.
