## What is a P&I Certificate of Entry?

In the global shipping industry, **Protection & Indemnity (P&I)** is a specialized form of mutual insurance. A **Certificate of Entry** is the proof that a vessel (e.g., a container ship or oil tanker) is a member of a "Club" and is insured for high-stakes liabilities: **Oil Spills**, **Crew Injury**, **Cargo Damage**, and **Wreck Removal**. These certificates are mandatory for a ship to enter any major port.

These documents are the "Entry Ticket" to global trade. Fraud is high-stakes: owners of "Substandard Ships" (which legitimate clubs won't insure) often create fake certificates from non-existent or "Shadow" P&I clubs to trick port authorities. If such a ship has an oil spill, there is no money for cleanup, leaving the host nation with billions in damage. Verified hashes bind the **Vessel IMO Number, Gross Tonnage, and Club Name** to the International Group of P&I Clubs' or the individual club's domain (e.g., `ukpandi.com` or `gard.no`).

## Data Verified

IMO number, vessel name, gross tonnage, call sign, member (owner) name, certificate number, policy year, coverage limits (Oil, Bunkers, Wreck), "Blue Card" status (CLC/Bunker conventions), P&I club name, date of entry.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Entry:** The primary proof of P&I membership.
- **Blue Card:** Specific certificate required for oil pollution liability.
- **Letter of Undertaking (LOU):** (Linked hash) a guarantee to prevent ship arrest.
- **War Risk Addendum:** Proving coverage for conflict zones.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ukpandi.com`, `gard.no`, `skuld.com`) and the vessel standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active Member** — Vessel is currently insured and premium is paid.
- **Terminated** — **CRITICAL:** Coverage has ended (e.g., due to vessel sale or safety breach).
- **Blue Card Suspended** — **ALERT:** The pollution-specific guarantee is no longer valid.
- **Under Sanctions** — **CRITICAL:** The vessel or owner has been flagged for international sanctions.

## Second-Party Use

The **Shipowner / Manager** benefits from verification.

**Port Entry Clearance:** Upon arrival at a port (e.g., Singapore or Rotterdam), the Master provides the verified hash of the P&I certificate. Port State Control (PSC) can instantly see **"ACTIVE - GARD"** on their tablet, bypassing the need for manual email verification and allowing the ship to dock immediately.

**Chartering Credibility:** Before a major oil company (e.g., Shell or Exxon) hires a tanker, they scan the P&I hash. Verification ensures the ship has the $1 billion pollution coverage required by their "Vetting Department."

## Third-Party Use

**Port State Control (PSC) Inspectors**
**Substandard Ship Detection:** Thousands of ships use fake "non-IG" club certificates to hide poor maintenance. Live Verify connects the inspector directly to the legitimate P&I club's domain, allowing them to instantly identify and "Arrest" ships with fraudulent insurance.

**Maritime Lawyers (Admiralty)**
**Arrest Prevention:** If a ship is involved in a collision, the P&I club issues a verified "Letter of Undertaking" (LOU). The victim's lawyer scans the hash to ensure the LOU is an authentic commitment from a solvent club, preventing the need to physically seize (arrest) the ship.

**Coastal Guard / Environmental Agencies**
**Spill Response Audit:** Instantly verifying the insurance limits of a grounded vessel to determine the available budget for emergency salvage and cleanup operations.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Shadow Club" Fraud Problem**

- **Logo Mimicry:** Creating a fake certificate using the name of a famous club but with a fraudulent contact address.
- **Limit Inflation:** Changing a $10M "non-IG" limit to a $1B "International Group" limit on a PDF.
- **Sanction Hiding:** Editing a certificate to hide the true "Beneficial Owner" of a vessel from a sanctioned nation.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**International Group (IG) P&I Clubs.**
**Fixed-Premium Marine Insurers.**
**National Maritime Authorities.**

**Privacy Salt:** Low to Medium. While vessel names are public, the specific "Claims History" and member premium rates are sensitive. The hash should be salted to protect commercial confidentiality.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

UK P&I Club issues maritime protection and indemnity certificates and is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance framework and maritime conventions.

```
✓ pi.ukpandi.com/verify — P&I club issuing maritime liability insurance certificates
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

P&I insurance is the "Global Shield" of the oceans. By turning certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the world's coastlines from the catastrophic cost of un-insured oil spills and ensure that "Safety at Sea" is backed by cryptographic proof.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the P&I club's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (vessel IMO, gross tonnage, policy year, coverage limits) — never beneficial owner or claim history — providing non-repudiation of the certificate and an audit trail port state control authorities can inspect.
