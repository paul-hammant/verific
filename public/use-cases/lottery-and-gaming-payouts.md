## What is a Lottery Win Receipt?

When a lottery player scans a ticket at a terminal or via an app and is informed of a major win, they receive a **Win Receipt** or a digital notification. This is the moment of peak value: a piece of paper or a screen showing "WINNER $500,000,000".

The **Conflict of Interest**: In most jurisdictions, the entity that issues the ticket and verifies the win (the Lottery Commission) is also the one that has to pay out the prize. If a system glitch or a dishonest official attempts to "delete" the win record before it is publicly announced, the player may have no way to prove they were ever informed of the win.

Live Verify with **Independent Witnessing** solves this. The moment the player sees the "WINNER" screen, they scan it. The hash is sent to an independent third-party witness (e.g., an audit firm or a public ledger). The Lottery Commission can no longer claim "no one won the draw" because a neutral record of the win notification exists.

## Fun Fact: The Essential Difference (Gambling vs. Insurance)

In the insurance industry, there is a classic riddle: *"What is the essential difference between gambling and insurance?"* The answer: *"In insurance, you must have a loss before you can have a win."*

In gambling, you are seeking a "win" without a prior loss. Because of this, gambling is often treated differently by the law. In many jurisdictions, gambling remains unregulated or exists in a legal grey area where "welching" (refusing to pay a legitimate win) can happen without law enforcement or the courts getting involved. In these environments, winning bets are often viewed as "debts of honor" rather than legally binding contracts. 

Witnessed hashes provide the immutable, third-party proof required to turn a "debt of honor" into an undeniable public claim, providing the winner with the leverage needed to ensure the payor doesn't disappear when the numbers hit.

## Data Verified

Win amount, draw name, draw date, ticket serial number, terminal ID, timestamp of verification, player ID (if registered).

**Document Types:**
- **Terminal Win Receipt:** Printed after scanning a winning ticket.
- **In-App Win Notification:** Digital screen shown to the player.
- **Claim Submission Form:** The first document filed to start the payout.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`statelottery.gov`) and the win standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid / Unclaimed** — Win is verified and awaiting payout.
- **Claimed** — **ALERT:** Prize has already been paid out to this or another person.
- **Pending Audit** — Under routine fraud review.
- **Invalid** — **CRITICAL:** Ticket reported stolen or draw voided.

## Second-Party Use

The **Lottery Player (Winner)** benefits from verification.

**Protection Against Denial:** If the Lottery Commission's database "loses" the record of the win (either via technical error or insider fraud), the player has a cryptographically witnessed proof that the terminal *did* inform them of a win at a specific second.

**Legal Leverage:** Proving to legal counsel that a win occurred, enabling the player to secure financing or representation before the physical cash is in hand.

## Third-Party Use

**Independent Auditors (EY, Deloitte)**
**Draw Integrity:** Auditors can cross-reference all witnessed hashes with the Lottery Commission's internal payout logs. Any witnessed win that doesn't have a corresponding payout record is a red flag for fraud.

**Banks / Wealth Managers**
**Early Financing:** A winner can show a witnessed hash to a bank to secure a bridge loan while waiting for the 30-60 day payout period to conclude.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Vanishing Win" Fraud Problem**

- **Database Deletion:** A corrupt IT administrator deleting a winning record to "reset" the jackpot for another draw (or to help a friend "find" the ticket later).
- **Technical Glitch:** A system crash between the moment the win is shown on screen and the moment it is committed to the central database.
- **Insider Swapping:** A clerk at a retail store telling a player "you didn't win," keeping the ticket, and then claiming the prize themselves later.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State/National Lottery Commissions.**
**Online Betting Platforms.**
**Casino Management Systems.**

**Privacy Salt:** High. Lottery wins are highly sensitive and often attract unwanted attention. The hash must be salted to ensure that only the winner (with the physical/digital receipt) can prove the win.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Lottery win notifications are issued by licensed operators and regulated by the UK gambling authority.

```
✓ national-lottery.co.uk/winner/verify — Issues lottery win notifications and payout confirmations
  ✓ gamblingcommission.gov.uk — Regulates gambling in Great Britain
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Lottery payouts are the ultimate test of "Issuer Integrity." When the issuer is also the payor of half a billion dollars, trust must be externalized. Independent witnessing turns a "Notification of Win" into an undeniable legal fact, protecting the player's life-changing moment from system failures or human greed.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the Lottery Commission's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (draw date, win amount, ticket ID, terminal location) — never player identity or banking details — providing non-repudiation of the win notification and an audit trail gaming regulators can inspect.
