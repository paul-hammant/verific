## The Problem

A Verification of Employment (VOE) letter confirms that a person works where they say they work and earns what they say they earn. It is one of the core documents in mortgage underwriting — the lender will not fund the loan without it.

**Why verification matters here:**

- **Fabricated employment letters are a primary mortgage fraud vector.** "Employment mills" sell fake VOE letters on letterhead of real companies, complete with HR contact details that route to the fraudster. The lender calls the number on the letter and gets a convincing confirmation of a job that does not exist. The loan is funded against fabricated income.
- **Income inflation is simple and effective.** Changing "$85,000 / Annual" to "$145,000 / Annual" on a PDF takes seconds. The borrower qualifies for a larger loan, buys a more expensive property, and defaults when the real income cannot service the debt. The lender holds the loss.
- **The employer benefits too.** When a fraudulent VOE is attributed to a company, the employer may be contacted during investigations or litigation. A verified hash on the employer's domain proves what the HR department actually issued — protecting the company from association with fraudulent loan applications.

<span data-verify-line="mort-voe">verify:acme-global.com/hr/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="mort-voe"></span>
</div>

## Data Verified

Employee name, legal employer name, current job title, employment status (Active/On-Leave), start date, base salary amount, bonus/commission history (linked hash), total annual income, issuing HR officer name, HRIS reference ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Verification of Employment (VOE):** Standard mortgage-specific form.
- **Paystub Summary:** (Linked hash) for the most recent 3 months.
- **W-2 Transcript:** (Linked hash) for year-end income proof.
- **Letter of Explanation:** (Linked hash) for large bonuses or gap in service.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`acme-global.com`, `workday.com`, `equifax.com`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Record matches the company's official payroll file.
- **Terminated** — **ALERT:** Bearer is no longer employed; income is $0.
- **Inactive** — Reference ID has expired (usually > 30-60 days).
- **Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** Reference ID associated with a known "Employment Mill."

## Second-Party Use

The **Borrower / Employee** (second party) receives the verification of employment from the employer (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of their employment status and salary. Most of the time, the document sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that it matches what the employer's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a mortgage application is disputed or income verification is challenged, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact HR.

## Third-Party Use

The borrower / employee (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Mortgage Underwriters (Lenders)**
**Zero-Trust Vetting:** Employment fraud is the most common cause of mortgage failure. Scammers create fake "HR" companies with fake phone numbers to verify fake salaries. Live Verify connects the underwriter directly to the real employer's domain, stopping "Fake Salary" fraud at the source.

**Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac Auditors**
**Portfolio Audit:** Instantly verifying thousands of loan files. Live Verify ensures that the VOE letters in the files weren't "Photoshopped" by a dishonest loan officer to meet a quota.

**Government Housing Agencies (FHA/VA)**
**Compliance:** Ensuring that loans meet federal "Ability-to-Repay" (ATR) laws based on verified, non-falsified income data.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Employment Mill" Fraud Problem**

- **Salary Inflation:** Editing a $45,000 salary to read $145,000 on a PDF to qualify for a larger house.
- **Ghost Employment:** Using a fake company name and website to "Verify" that an unemployed person has a high-paying job.
- **Termination Hiding:** Providing a VOE letter dated yesterday for an employee who was actually fired two months ago.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Corporate HR Departments (Hosting on their own `/hr` or `/legal` domain)
- Payroll Processors (ADP, Gusto, Paychex - hosting the hashes)
- Employment Data Hubs (e.g., The Work Number / Equifax)

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Salary and employment status are highly sensitive. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches for high-earning employees. Even though documents contain unique employee IDs and names, salary amounts and job titles are often enumerable (common salary bands like $50k, $75k, $100k, $145k combined with standard titles), making brute-force attacks feasible without salt.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the employer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (job title, employment status, employment dates, verification ID) — never employee names, salary amounts, or SSNs — providing non-repudiation of employment verification issuance.

## Competition vs. The Work Number (Equifax)

| Feature | Live Verify | The Work Number | Manual Phone Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Employee shares only the *Single VOE*. | **Low.** Lenders see full historical data pool. | **Medium.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Employer. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any small firm with a URL. | **Limited.** Only for large firms who pay for TWN. | **Universal.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Lenders pay $50-$100 per check. | **High.** Costs in human time. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Local SMB" reality. Millions of people work for small law firms, dental offices, or local construction companies that aren't on "The Work Number." They rely on "Persistent Paper" letters. Live Verify turns those **Manual Letters** into a "Fortune 500" level trust artifact, bringing modern security to the entire housing economy.

</pre>
<span data-verify-line="income">verify:acme-global.com/payroll/v</span> <span verifiable-text="end" data-for="income"></span>
</div>

## Data Verified

Employee name, SSN/TIN (redacted), employer name, pay period dates, gross earnings, net pay, itemized withholdings (Taxes/401k), Year-to-Date (YTD) totals, issuing payroll provider ID, date of payment.

**Document Types:**
- **Pay Stub (Earnings Statement):** The primary bi-weekly income proof.
- **W-2 Wage & Tax Statement:** For annual aggregate verification.
- **1099-NEC / 1099-MISC:** For independent contractors.
- **Verification of Income (VOI):** Formal summary from HR.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`adp.com`, `gusto.com`, `acme-global.com`) and current record status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Pay details match the official payroll system ledger.
- **Amended** — A correction was issued for this pay period.
- **Final** — (For W-2) Statement matches the federal filing with the IRS.
- **Void** — Check/ACH reversed due to error or fraud.

## Second-Party Use

The **Borrower / Employee** (second party) receives the paystub from the employer (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of their earnings and withholdings. Most of the time, the document sits in their files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the paystub matches what the payroll system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a loan application is disputed or tax records are challenged, they have cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the payroll department.

## Third-Party Use

The borrower / employee (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Mortgage Underwriters**
**Zero-Trust Vetting:** Income fraud is the most common cause of mortgage failure. Live Verify ensures the applicant hasn't "Photoshopped" a $4,000 net pay into a $14,000 net pay. Underwriters can scan the hash to see the real number from the payroll provider's domain.

**Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac Auditors**
**Portfolio Audit:** Instantly verifying the "Quality of Income" in a pool of 10,000 loans by scanning the original pay stub hashes.

**Government Agencies (IRS / HUD)**
**Anti-Fraud Enforcement:** Ensuring that income claims made for government-backed loans or tax credits match the verified corporate records.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Income Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Numerical Tampering:** Editing a PDF paystub to change a $2,000 net pay to $12,000 to qualify for a larger home.
- **YTD Inflation:** Increasing the "Year-to-Date" total to hide that the borrower was recently unemployed for 6 months.
- **Fabricated Employers:** Creating a fake company website and fake paystubs to "Verify" that an unemployed person has a high-paying job.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Payroll Processors (ADP, Gusto, Paychex, Rippling)
- Corporate HR Departments (Hosting on their own `/payroll` domain)
- Tax Portals

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Salary and tax data is highly sensitive. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Brute Force" searching of a company's entire payroll to see who makes the most money. Salary amounts and YTD totals are often enumerable (round numbers, standard pay periods), making rainbow table attacks feasible without salt.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Employers and payroll providers issue employment and income verification for mortgage underwriting. The issuer is self-authorized as the employer responsible for payroll records.

```
✓ hr.example-corp.com/mortgage-verify/verify — Issues verified employment offers and income documentation
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the payroll processor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (pay periods, gross amounts, YTD totals, verification IDs) — never employee names, SSNs, addresses, or bank details — providing non-repudiation of paystub issuance.

## Competition vs. The Work Number (Equifax)

| Feature | Live Verify | The Work Number | Scanned PDF / Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Privacy** | **High.** Employee shares only the *Single Paystub*. | **Low.** Lenders see full historical data pool. | **High.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Employer. | **Data-Bound.** Trust the aggregator. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any small firm with a URL. | **Limited.** Only for large firms who pay for TWN. | **Universal.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Lenders pay $50-$100 per check. | **None.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Local Business" reality. Millions of people work for small firms that aren't on "The Work Number." They rely on "Persistent Paper" paystubs. Live Verify turns those **Manual Artifacts** into "Fortune 500" level trust artifacts, bringing modern security to the entire housing economy.
