## Data Verified

Adjuster name, IA (Independent Adjuster) license number, hiring carrier name, Claim ID, property address, inspection date, estimated RCV (Replacement Cost Value), cause of loss code, primary scope of work (digest), date of report issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Field Inspection Report:** The primary narrative and estimate.
- **Photo Sheet:** (Linked hash) for every damage photo taken.
- **Narrative Report:** Adjuster's personal opinion on liability/coverage.
- **Preliminary Loss Report:** First 24-hour assessment.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`crawco.com`, `eberls.com`, `alacritysolutions.com`) and report status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final/Closed** — Report is complete and transmitted to the carrier.
- **Preliminary** — Initial assessment; subject to supplement.
- **Amended** — A revised report exists (e.g., due to hidden damage found later).
- **Void** — Assigned to wrong claim or adjuster error.

## Second-Party Use

The **Hiring Insurance Carrier** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Tampering:** Ensuring that the "IA Report" uploaded by a third-party firm hasn't been "Modified" by a broker or contractor before it hits the carrier's core ledger. A verified hash from the IA firm's domain provides the carrier with a "Sanitized Audit Trail" for high-value claims.

**Subrogation:** Proving the "Proximate Cause" to a third-party tortfeasor's insurer using a verified, immutable expert assessment from the field.

## Third-Party Use

**Property Owners (Policyholders)**
**Transparency:** Proving to themselves that the "IA Estimate" provided by the contractor matches what the independent adjuster actually sent to the insurance company. Verification prevents "Contractor Padding" where the crew claims the adjuster authorized $50k when they only authorized $40k.

**Legal Counsel (Plaintiffs/Defense)**
**Discovery Admissibility:** Instantly verifying that a 3-year-old field report used as evidence in a bad-faith lawsuit is the original, non-altered version.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Repair Audit:** Verifying that the $42,500 insurance payout is actually intended for the "Hardwood Floors" (the bank's collateral) and not just a cash payout for personal items.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Estimate Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Scope Inflation:** A contractor editing the IA's PDF to add 500 extra square feet of flooring to over-charge the carrier.
- **Cause of Loss Forgery:** Changing "Flood" (uninsured) to "Pipe Burst" (insured) on the paper report to trigger a payout.
- **License Fraud:** An unlicensed trainee performing the inspection but using a master adjuster's verified signature on the final PDF.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**IA Firms:** (Crawford & Co, Eberl, Sedgwick, Alacrity).
**Independent Adjusters:** (Solo practitioners).
**Inspection Platforms:** (e.g., Xactimate/Verisk - hosting the underlying data hashes).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Independent adjusters are licensed professionals who investigate insurance loss claims.

```
✓ adjuster.crawco.co.uk — Issues insurance loss assessments
  ✓ cila.co.uk — Regulates UK claims professionals
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the independent adjuster firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (claim number, property address, adjuster name and license number, inspection date, damage estimate, cause of loss category, report number) — never plaintext claim details or settlement amounts — providing non-repudiation of the independent adjuster report.


## Competition vs. Claims Management Portals

| Feature | Live Verify | Claims Portal (Guidewire) | Scanned PDF Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the IA Firm. | **System-Bound.** Trust the Carrier's IT. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Share with any contractor/bank. | **Zero.** External parties never get portal access. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Details.** Protects the RCV amount. | **High.** | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Works across 100+ different IA firms. | **Low.** Every carrier uses a different system. | **Universal.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "External Vetting" gap. Carriers and IA firms operate in private silos. Contractors and banks are locked out. Live Verify turns the **Field Inspection PDF** into a portable, cryptographically trusted link that bridges the gap between the field expert and the people paying the bills.
