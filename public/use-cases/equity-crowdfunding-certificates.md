## What is a Reg CF Certificate?

In the old days, only rich people could invest in startups. Today, through **Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF)**, anyone can buy shares in a "Future Unicorn" for as little as $100.

The **Stock Certificate** is your proof of ownership. It proves you own a tiny piece of a private company (like a robotics startup or a new brewery).

Because these shares aren't traded on the stock market (like Apple or Tesla), they are easy to fake. Scammers often sell "Fake Equity" in hot startups using realistic-looking PDF certificates. Verified hashes allow an investor to prove their ownership to a bank or a secondary buyer instantly.

## Data Verified

Shareholder name, company name, number of shares, share class (Common/Preferred), issuance date, certificate number, regulation type (Reg CF, Reg A+), valuation at time of issuance (optional), platform ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Stock Certificate:** Formal proof of ownership.
- **Investment Confirmation:** Issued immediately after the "Close" of a round.
- **SAFE Agreement:** Simple Agreement for Future Equity (with hash of terms).
- **K-1 Tax Form:** (Linked hash) for annual tax reporting.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`startengine.com`, `wefunder.com`, `republic.com`) and current share standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Shareholder is on the official cap table.
- **Transferred** — Shares have been sold or moved to a secondary market.
- **Cancelled** — Shareholder has exited or round was voided.
- **Converted** — SAFE or Note has converted into equity.

## Second-Party Use

The **Investor (Shareholder)** benefits from verification.

**Secondary Sales:** If an investor wants to sell their private shares on a secondary platform (e.g., Forge or EquityZen), they can show the "Verified Certificate." This prevents "Phantom Stock" fraud and allows the buyer to trust the holding without waiting for the company's legal team to reply.

**Mortgage / Wealth Proof:** Proving to a bank's wealth management department that the investor has $100,000 in "Verified Private Equity," which can be used to qualify for "Asset-Based" loans or high-tier credit cards.

## Third-Party Use

**Secondary Market Platforms**
**Cap Table Integrity:** Before listing a company's shares for trade, the platform verifies the individual certificates of the sellers. Live Verify ensures the seller actually owns the 1,000 shares they claim.

**Startup CEOs / Founders**
**Governance:** Instantly verifying the identity and holding of a shareholder who is requesting access to a private company meeting or voting on a board resolution.

**The SEC / Regulators**
**Compliance Audit:** Ensuring that "Regulation Crowdfunding" companies are staying within their 2,000-investor limits by verifying the digital trail of issued certificates.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Zombies and Ghosts" Fraud Problem**

- **Zombie Certificates:** Selling shares that were already transferred to someone else 6 months ago. Verification shows the "Transferred" status.
- **Phantom Equity:** Using a template to create a fake certificate for a hot startup (e.g., SpaceX) to trick a private buyer into wiring money.
- **Amount Tampering:** Changing 100 shares to 10,000 shares on a PDF to use as collateral for a loan.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Funding Portals:** (StartEngine, Wefunder, Republic).
**Transfer Agents:** (e.g., Carta, Computershare).
**Law Firms:** (Managing private cap tables).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Crowdcube issues equity crowdfunding investment certificates for UK startups.

```
✓ shares.crowdcube.com/verify — Issues equity crowdfunding investment certificates
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK investment firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the platform's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (investor ID, investment amount, funding round date, security class) — never investor name, personal financial details, or cap table information — providing non-repudiation of the equity certificate issuance.


## Competition vs. Cap Table Software (Carta)

| Feature | Live Verify | Carta / Pulley (Platform) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Share with any buyer/bank. | **Siloed.** Requires buyer to be invited to the portal. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Transfer Agent. | **System-Bound.** | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Interoperability** | **High.** Works across all 50+ startup platforms. | **Low.** Hard to prove status to a non-user. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Content.** Protects the share count. | **Data-Only.** | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Exit" reality. Startups often change transfer agents or go out of business. Live Verify turns the **Static Certificate** in the investor's "Digital Vault" into a permanent, verifiable link to the official record, ensuring the equity remains a trade-able asset even if the original portal changes software.
