## What is a Locksmith Credential?

Locksmiths are not just another licensed profession. They arrive at the door during a moment of acute vulnerability: lockout, after-hours distress, property access disputes, or urgent re-entry. The homeowner or driver is not really asking "is this person broadly in the profession?" They are asking:

- is this the real company I called?
- is this person actually authorized to represent that company?
- do they have the right license scope and bonding for this work?

That makes locksmithing a threshold-decision case, closer to home-service verification than to decorative professional licensing.

## Data Verified

Licensee name, photo (hash), license number, business DBA name, expiration date, bonding status, company/dispatch identity, and issuing state bureau.

**Document Types:**
- **Locksmith Field Credential:** Carried by the technician in the field.
- **Company Registration:** For the locksmith storefront.
- **Certificate of Bonding:** Proving the consumer is protected against theft.
- **Apprentice Permit:** For locksmiths-in-training under supervision.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`bsis.ca.gov`, `nc-locksmithboard.org`) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — License is valid; bearer is eligible to perform work.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Access revoked (e.g., due to criminal record or expired bond).
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from the profession.
- **Expired** — Renewal application or fee overdue.
- **WRONG_COMPANY** — Technician may be real, but not from the company the customer expected.
- **NOT_ASSIGNED** — Technician identity may be real, but not dispatched for this call.

## Second-Party Use

The **Locksmith (Practitioner)** benefits from verification.

**Protects both sides.** The homeowner locked out at midnight needs to know the person at the door is legitimate before handing over access to their entire home. The locksmith needs the homeowner to trust them quickly — otherwise the job takes longer, the interaction is tense, and neighbours may call the police. A verified credential resolves both problems in seconds. Legitimate locksmiths suffer disproportionately from the "bandit locksmith" problem: every scam operator who overcharges or cases homes for burglary makes the next genuine locksmith's job harder.

**Customer Trust:** Proving at 2 AM that they are not just "some guy from Craigslist with a drill," but the right technician from the right company with real standing and bonding.

**Police Interaction:** If a locksmith is stopped by police while picking a lock (at a customer's request), the verified badge provides the officer with instant confirmation of their professional authority.

## Third-Party Use

**Homeowners / Car Owners**
**Burglary Prevention:** Criminals often pose as mobile locksmiths to gain entry to properties or to duplicate keys for later use. The important check is not just active licensure, but company identity and dispatch legitimacy.

**Service Marketplaces (Google / Yelp)**
**Merchant Vetting:** Google currently "Local Services Verified" for locksmiths. Live Verify turns that one-time check into a **Continuous Audit Link**, ensuring that a merchant who is suspended by the state is instantly removed from the search results.

**Commercial Property Managers**
**Liability Control:** Ensuring that only licensed and bonded professionals are performing "Master Keying" on a large office complex.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Phantom Key" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** Burglars buying realistic uniforms and fake "Locksmith" badges to case homes or install "Backdoor" locks for future entry.
- **Credential Hiding:** A technician whose license was revoked for stealing from a client keeping their physical ID to find work in a different county.
- **Bond Forgery:** Creating a fake "Certificate of Bonding" PDF to trick a landlord into allowing a high-security lock change.
- **Dispatch Substitution:** Customer calls one company but a different subcontractor or scam operation arrives.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Licensing Boards:** (e.g., California BSIS, Nevada State Fire Marshal).
**Municipal Licensing:** (In states without centralized boards).
**Professional Associations:** (e.g., ALOA Security Professionals).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Locksmith names and locations are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Stalking" attacks where someone tries to track a specific technician's daily route.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated / commercial

Locksmith licensing bodies confirm standing and bonding. The dispatching firm or marketplace may separately need to confirm that this technician is the one actually assigned to the call.

```
✓ mla.com — Issues Master Locksmiths Association credentials
✓ dispatch.example-locksmith.co.uk/verify — Confirms current company dispatch for this call
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the state licensing board's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (licensee names, license numbers, company names, bonding status, expiration dates, dispatch affiliations) — never home addresses or job site locations — providing non-repudiation of the license and an audit trail law enforcement can inspect.

## Competition vs. Review Sites (Yelp)

| Feature | Live Verify | Yelp / Google Reviews | Physical ID Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the State Gov. | **Social-Bound.** Trusted via crowd opinion. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to license. | **Vulnerable.** Reviews can be faked/bought. | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires reading multiple reviews. | **Instant.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if banned *today*. | **N/A.** | **Static.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Emergency Moment." Most people call a locksmith when they are locked out and stressed. They don't want to engage in a long conversation or a deep-dive on Yelp. Live Verify turns the **ID Badge** into a live, non-confrontational safety tool that provides instant, high-authority trust at the door.
