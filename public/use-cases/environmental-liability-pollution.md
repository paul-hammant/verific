## What is Pollution Insurance?

If a chemical plant or a landfill accidentally poisons the groundwater of a town, the cleanup costs can reach **$100 million or more**. Most normal insurance policies exclude this risk. Companies must buy a specialized **Pollution Legal Liability (PLL)** policy.

These policies are critical for "Brownfield" redevelopments (turning old factories into apartments). No bank will lend on toxic land without verified proof of pollution insurance.

Fraud is high-stakes here: sellers often edit the "Retroactive Date" on their policy to hide that they weren't insured back in 1985 when the original leak happened. Verified hashes ensure the bank and the public are looking at the **true history of the safety net**.

## Data Verified

Named insured, specific covered site address, cleanup cost limits, 3rd party liability limits, "Sudden vs Gradual" release status, retroactive date, policy term (often 10+ years), issuing carrier (NAIC code).

**Document Types:**
- **Pollution Legal Liability (PLL):** For site owners.
- **Contractors Pollution Liability (CPL):** For remediation firms.
- **Closure/Post-Closure Bond:** For landfills and hazardous waste sites.
- **Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL).**

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`chubb.com`, `aig.com`, `zurich.com`) and policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Premium paid; coverage active.
- **Terminated** — Policy cancelled (major risk for brownfield developments).
- **Limit Depleted** — **ALERT:** Prior claims have used up the available cleanup funds.
- **Lapsed** — Coverage expired without renewal.

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner / Developer** (second party) receives the pollution insurance policy from the insurer (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the environmental coverage. Most of the time, the policy sits in their project files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the policy matches what the insurer's system recorded, including the critical retroactive date, and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If contamination is discovered or a dispute arises about coverage, they have cryptographic proof of the policy terms ready without needing to contact the insurer.

## Third-Party Use

The property owner (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Environmental Regulators (EPA / State DEPs)**
**Financial Assurance:** Ensuring that high-risk industrial operators (e.g., chemical plants or landfills) maintain verified, non-cancelled insurance to pay for future cleanup, preventing "Superfund" abandonments.

**Abutters / Neighboring Communities**
**Transparency:** Allowing local residents to verify that a nearby industrial project is actually insured for "Gradual Releases" (like groundwater contamination) and not just "Sudden Spills."

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Collateral Protection:** Verifying the "Retroactive Date." If the policy doesn't cover contamination from 1985, the bank's collateral could be worthless if an old leak is found.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Clean Hands" Fraud Problem**

- **Retroactive Erasure:** Editing a 1985 retroactive date to 2025 to hide a known historical leak during a property sale.
- **Limit Inflation:** Editing a $1M "Limited" policy to look like a $10M "Full Site" policy to close a real estate deal.
- **Gradual Exclusion:** Deleting the clause that excludes "Gradual Seepage" to make a cheap policy look like a comprehensive one.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Specialty Carriers (Chubb, AIG, Great American, Ironshore)
- Environmental MGAs
- Environmental Law Firms (hosting verified hashes for settlement funds)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Pollution insurance policies often contain enumerable values—round dollar limits ($1M, $5M, $10M), standard retroactive dates, and publicly known site addresses. A competitor or neighboring property owner could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a property's contamination history and coverage strategy, gaining unfair advantage in real estate negotiations or litigation. Salt protects these sensitive environmental and financial details.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

AIG underwrites environmental liability and pollution insurance for contaminated sites.

```
✓ pollution.aig.co.uk/verify — Underwrites environmental liability and pollution insurance
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, coverage limits, policy period, retroactive date, site location, coverage type) — never contamination details or remediation plans — providing non-repudiation of pollution coverage and an audit trail for EPA financial assurance compliance and property liability disputes.

## Competition vs. Broker Letters

| Feature | Live Verify | Manual Broker Letter | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Human.** Prone to errors or social engineering. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Durability** | **30+ Years.** Archival text. | **Low.** Brokers often lose files after 7 years. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Retro Date.** Protects the history. | **Vague.** "Yes, they are insured." | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Takes days to retrieve archival files. | **Instant.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Long Tail" of Pollution. Contamination is often discovered 20 years after a policy was written. The original broker may be retired and the carrier's IT system migrated twice. Live Verify turns the **Static Paper Declaration** into an immutable link to the carrier's permanent ledger, ensuring the "Financial Safety Net" works when it's needed decades later.
