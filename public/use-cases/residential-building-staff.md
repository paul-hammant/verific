## What is a Residential Building Staff Badge?

In an apartment building or residential complex, a plumber, electrician, HVAC technician, or maintenance worker may arrive at your door to provide service. As a resident—especially if alone, elderly, or unfamiliar with the building—you face a critical decision: **is this person actually authorized to be here?**

The **Building Service Staff Badge** is the contractor's or employee's proof of authorization from the building management or property owner.

Impostors posing as maintenance workers use this as a pretense to gain entry: they case the apartment, steal valuables, follow residents inside to assess layout and security, or worse. E-Ink badges with real-time authorization status allow residents to verify a worker's credentials before opening the door—confirming they're assigned to that property, to that unit, and authorized to work at that time.

This is one of the stronger Live Verify families precisely because it is not a decorative credential problem. The resident is making an immediate threshold decision about a stranger entering private space, and the verification claim is assignment-specific: this worker, this unit, this time window.

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the resident's perspective. The maintenance visit is initiated by building management or a service request.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** Building management can enter units under maintenance authority, and residents who refuse access may face lease consequences or delayed repairs.

**Verification asymmetry:** The resident is being asked to open the door immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the worker is authorized by building management, assigned to this unit, and cleared to work at this time.

**Photo catches substitution:** The verification response includes a `photo_url` field. The badge may verify as "OK" for this unit and time window, but if the face at the door doesn't match the photo on file, the resident has caught a substitution — a different person using a legitimate worker's credential. This matters because building contractors routinely send whoever is available rather than the specific worker who was vetted and scheduled.

**Verification protects the worker too.** Contractors entering residents' private apartments are exposed to false accusations — theft claims, property damage allegations, or complaints about conduct. A verified interaction log with a timestamp proves the worker was legitimately authorized, assigned to that unit, and present during a specific window, providing contemporaneous evidence if a resident dispute arises later.

*The server rotates the salt — after each successful scan (burn-on-verify) or on TTL expiry of an unscanned salt — and the badge re-renders to match. The screen is always in lockstep with the salt the server will honour, so a photograph is worthless unless verified in the moment. See [E-Ink ID Cards](../e-ink-id-cards.md) for how this prevents cloning and tracking.*

## Data Verified

Staff or contractor name, photo (hash), license/credential number (for licensed trades), company affiliation, license status (Active/Expired/Suspended), assigned property and unit(s), work order number and scope, authorized time window (date range, hours), insurance/bonding status (hash), and background check clearance (hash).

**Document Types:**
- **Building Staff ID:** Permanent building maintenance, security, concierge staff
- **Contractor Service Badge:** Temporary contractors (plumber, electrician, HVAC, appliance repair) with active work order
- **Emergency Service Credential:** Fire, police, paramedics, or utility company responders
- **Third-Party Service License Verification:** Licensed trades (electricians, plumbers) verified against state licensing boards

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Contractor is currently authorized for work at this property/unit within the scheduled time window
- **NOT_SCHEDULED** — Work order not in system or outside scheduled window; do not admit
- **SUSPENDED** — Access revoked due to safety issue, license suspension, or background check failure
- **EXPIRED_LICENSE** — Contractor's trade license or bonding has lapsed
- **INVALID_UNIT** — Badge issued for different unit; contractor attempting to access wrong apartment
- **404** — Badge not found (forged, terminated, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `id.equityapartments.com`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, residents may record the visit:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: OK

--- Optional Follow-Up ---

You may record details of this service visit.
You will NEVER be told not to do this or that it is not needed.

POST to: https://equityapartments.com/resident-feedback/visit/7x2p9k4m

Fields:
- Unit number
- Service type: [Plumbing / Electrical / HVAC / Maintenance / Other]
- Work completed: [Yes / Partially / No]
- Quality: [Excellent / Good / Concerns]
- Areas accessed: [Kitchen / Bathroom / Bedroom / Living area / Utility]
- Any concerns or issues?
- Request management callback? [Y/N]
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Theft deterrent:** Contractors know residents can record which areas were accessed; creates accountability
- **Pattern detection:** Contractor receiving frequent "concerns" across multiple units triggers review
- **Dispute resolution:** If something goes missing, there's a contemporaneous record of who entered and what areas
- **Work quality tracking:** Management sees which contractors consistently deliver quality work
- **Hours verification:** Residents can note arrival/departure times; prevents contractors billing inflated hours

**The "Never Discouraged" Principle:**

Contractors should never tell residents "don't bother" or "that's not necessary." Every report is logged. Management can triage later—but the resident is never made to feel their input isn't wanted.

## Second-Party Use

The **Building Staff Member or Contractor** benefits from verification.

**Professional Credibility & Safety:** Verification reduces confrontation when entering a resident's home. Residents are less suspicious when they can instantly confirm legitimacy, reducing chance of alarm calls or aggressive confrontation.

**Liability Protection:** Verified badge creates a timestamped record of authorized presence, protecting contractors from false theft accusations or liability disputes ("they were never in my apartment!").

**Access to Secured Areas:** Proving verified status to building entry systems, elevator access control, or utility room locks.

## Third-Party Use

**Residents**
**Fraud & Burglary Prevention:** Before opening the door, a resident can request to see the contractor's badge and scan it (via peephole camera, doorbell camera, or by viewing through a partially open door). Verification confirms the person is a legitimate, authorized contractor for their unit at this time—preventing "maintenance imposter" burglaries.

**Insurance & Liability:** If theft or property damage occurs, a resident can verify whether a contractor was actually authorized to be present, protecting their insurance claim.

**Work Order Confirmation:** Scanning confirms the work order matches what the contractor is claiming (e.g., "I'm here to fix the kitchen sink," verified as unit 412, plumbing service)

**Building Management & Security**
**Audit Integrity:** Verification logs show exactly which contractors entered which units at what time, enabling security audits and theft investigations

**License & Bonding Verification:** Automated confirmation that contractors maintain current licenses and insurance, protecting the building from liability

**Ghost Contractor Detection:** Identifying when contractors claim to have worked but never actually entered the building, or when unauthorized contractors attempt entry

**Incident Investigation:** When theft or property damage occurs, cross-referencing verified scans with incident timing identifies who was actually present

## Verification Architecture

**The "Contractor Imposter" Fraud Problem**

- **Residential Burglary:** Impostors in work clothes scout apartments, test doors for valuables, or gain entry when residents are out
- **Follow-In Burglary:** Impostor follows resident inside ("I'm here to fix the AC"), then commits theft or assault after resident is in a compromised position
- **Identity Theft:** Impostors gain access to documents, mail, or personal information during "maintenance" calls
- **Credential Spoofing:** Unlicensed contractors falsely claiming to be from a licensed company; fake uniforms and vests purchased online
- **License Fraud:** Contractors with suspended or expired licenses continuing to work

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Building Management Companies:** (Equity Residential, AvalonBay, Greystar, local property management firms)
**Contractor Networks:** (Plumbing, electrical, HVAC companies, appliance repair franchises)
**State Licensing Boards:** (Electrician, plumber, HVAC licenses) issuing credential verification
**Insurance Companies:** (Contractor bonding and liability insurance verification)

**Privacy Salt:** Important. Contractor schedules and unit locations are sensitive information. Hashes must be salted to prevent tracking which units are vacant or which residents are out of town based on work order patterns.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues staff safety certifications

```
✓ staff.example-management.co.uk/verify — Issues staff safety certifications
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the management company's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (contractor ID, work order number, unit assignment, authorized time window) — never contractor address or service history — providing non-repudiation of the authorization and an audit trail residents and management can inspect.


## Competition vs. Uniforms / Management Call-Back

| Feature | Live Verify | Uniform & Visible Badge | Calling Building Management | Asking for ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Verified by building mgmt or state licensing board. | **Visual.** Uniforms and vests easily faked. | **Human.** Assumes someone answers; risky to leave door open while calling. | **Document-Based.** Resident must visually inspect ID; forged credentials look realistic. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds contractor to work order and unit. | **Zero.** Impostors in contractor clothing indistinguishable. | **Variable.** Management system may have lag or outdated info. | **Low.** Fake IDs are readily available online. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 3-second scan at door. | **N/A.** Just looking. | **Slow.** 5+ minutes to reach management; awkward to leave door open. | **Slow.** Requires examining documents, asking questions. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if work order is active *today*, if license is current. | **Static.** Badge never updates. | **Variable.** Management may not know latest updates. | **Static.** ID doesn't update if license expired overnight. |
| **Works Alone** | **Yes.** Resident can verify without needing to call anyone. | **Questionable.** Resident must judge appearance and make a call. | **No.** Resident must open door or leave it open to call. | **Somewhat.** Resident can examine ID but can't verify authenticity. |

**Why this remains strong:** The real issue is the home-entry threshold decision. A resident must decide alone, in seconds, at the front door, whether to allow a stranger into a private home. Building management systems remain primary in the background, but they are often not comfortably accessible at that moment. That makes the badge or work-order credential a strong surface for immediate, resident-controlled verification.

## Adoption Nuances: Overcoming Resident Skepticism

**For building management companies evaluating implementation:**

**Resident Adoption:** Unlike hotels where verification is optional guest safety, residents have limited incentive to scan badges for contractors they're expecting. The value proposition only works if residents are naturally skeptical about door entry. Know your resident demographics before deploying.

**Work Order Integration:** Verification must tie to your maintenance scheduling system. Contractor shows up for unit 412 on Friday 9-5, but work order doesn't exist in your system—resident correctly refuses entry, but you have a service gap. Budget time integrating badges with scheduling software.

**Contractor Resistance:** Plumbers, electricians, and HVAC companies work multiple buildings. They won't want separate badges per building. Provide centralized distribution, lanyards, or contractual requirements.

**Insurance & Liability:** If a verified contractor commits theft, they may claim "Verification proves I was authorized, so I'm not liable." Work with insurance and legal counsel on liability implications *before* deployment.

**Implementation Timeline:** 8-12 months (contractor coordination adds friction compared to hotels).
