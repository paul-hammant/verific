## What is a Work Permit (EAD)?

An **Employment Authorization Document (EAD)** is the ID card issued by the US government giving a non-citizen the legal right to work.

For a business owner, this card is high-stakes. If they hire someone with a fake card, they can be fined thousands of dollars. The problem? High-quality fakes are everywhere.

The strongest production answer is still the official employer-verification workflow. Live Verify is only credible as a bridge when a relying party is holding the physical card, screenshot, or copied notice outside that native system and needs a lighter path back to current status.

## Data Verified

Full name, USCIS number (A-Number), Category code (e.g., C03, C08, C09), Card serial number, effective date, expiration date, photograph (via hash), fingerprint status (hash), issuing office.

**Document Types:**
- **Employment Authorization Document (EAD):** (Form I-766).
- **Extension Notice (I-797):** Proving the 180/540-day automatic extension.
- **Grant of Asylum / Withholding:** (Linked document hash).

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Bearer is legally eligible to work in the U.S.
- **PENDING_RENEWAL** — Application filed; automatic extension active; eligible to work
- **REVOKED** — Authorization terminated (e.g., underlying case denied); do not hire
- **EXPIRED** — No longer eligible; renewal required; do not hire until renewed
- **404** — Card not found (forged document, wrong number, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the card itself (e.g., `uscis.gov`).

## Post-Verification Actions

None typically. The verification confirms work authorization status; that's the decision point for hiring.

**Why No Further Action:**

- **Employers** just need status to complete I-9 and proceed with hiring
- **Banks** just need confirmation for KYC compliance
- **DMVs** just need to confirm legal presence for Real ID

The status code is the value. If it's OK or PENDING_RENEWAL, proceed. If it's REVOKED, EXPIRED, or 404, don't. No POST form needed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Employee (Authorized Worker)** benefits from verification.

**Hiring Efficiency:** Proving to an HR manager that their "Category C08" card is legitimate and hasn't been "Revoked" by the government. A verified card removes the employer's fear of "I-9 Audit" fines, making the worker much more hireable.

**Bank Account Opening:** Proving legal status to a bank to comply with "Know Your Customer" (KYC) rules for individuals without a Green Card or Social Security Number.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers (HR Managers)**
**I-9 Compliance:** The strongest answer is still the official employer-verification workflow. Live Verify is more defensible when the employer is stuck working from the card itself and needs a lightweight bridge to current government status.

**Social Security Administration**
**SSN Issuance:** Verifying the work authorization before assigning an SSN.

**State DMVs**
**Driver's Licensing:** Verifying legal presence for non-immigrant driver's licenses (Real ID).

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-End Forgery" Fraud Problem**

- **Ghost Documents:** Fraudsters using high-end printers to create EAD cards for people who never applied for status.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A worker whose asylum claim was denied (revoking their EAD) keeping the physical card to trick a new employer.
- **Category Tampering:** Changing a "Student" (Restricted) category to an "Asylum" (Unrestricted) category.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS):** The sole issuer.
**DHS SAVE System:** (The backend source of truth).

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Immigration data is a high-value target for identity theft. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific immigrants.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Issues employment authorization documents for non-citizens.

```
✓ uscis.gov/ead/verify — Issues employment authorization documents for non-citizens
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. E-Verify / SAVE

| Feature | Live Verify | E-Verify (Employer System) | Physical EAD Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `uscis.gov`. | **Direct DB Access.** High trust. | **Mechanical.** Prone to forgery. |
| **User Access** | **Useful when working from the card or a copy.** | **Primary.** Official employer path. | **Manual.** |
| **Speed** | **Fast bridge from the artifact.** | **Can be slower.** Sometimes manual review takes days. | **Instant.** |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Verified at the point of use. | **Low.** Data resides in a federal monitoring system. | **N/A.** |

**Narrower conclusion:** This is not a replacement for E-Verify, SAVE, or formal immigration-status adjudication. It is strongest only as a portability layer for copied or visually presented EAD artifacts in lower-capability workflows.
