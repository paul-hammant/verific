## What are Work Equipment Safety Tags?

In industrial settings, machinery must be kept in a safe operating condition. Regulations such as **PUWER 1998** (UK) and **OSHA 29 CFR 1910** (US) require that work equipment is suitable for use, maintained, and inspected at appropriate intervals.

**Safety Tags** or labels attached to machines prove that guards, interlocks, and emergency stops have been tested. Without visible, verified proof, workers may unknowingly operate equipment with "hidden" failures (like a bypassed safety sensor). Verified hashes bind the **Machine ID, Inspection Result, and Next Due Date** to the employer's or the inspection firm's domain.

## Data Verified

Machine ID/Serial, facility location, last inspection date, inspection result (Pass/Fail), inspector ID, next inspection due date, regulation reference (e.g., PUWER Reg 6).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., the factory or maintenance firm) and the current safety standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Pass / Active** — Equipment is current and safe for use.
- **Fail / Lockout** — **CRITICAL:** Equipment failed inspection; do not operate.
- **Overdue** — **ALERT:** Inspection period has passed; equipment must be re-vetted.

## Second-Party Use

The **Machine Operator** benefits from verification.
- **Start-of-Shift Safety:** Scanning the tag on a lathe or press to ensure the "Pass" status is real and hasn't been "pencil whipped" by a previous shift.

## Third-Party Use

**OSHA / HSE Inspectors**
- **Rapid Compliance Audit:** During a walkthrough, inspectors can scan random tags to ensure they match the digital maintenance logs, stopping "backdated" paper records.

**Insurance Risk Engineers**
- **Premium Vetting:** Verifying that a high-risk factory is maintaining its 100% inspection rate for heavy machinery.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Work equipment inspectors verify that machinery is maintained and guarded to prevent worker injury, regulated by health and safety authorities requiring periodic compliance certification.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive employers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (machine ID/serial, facility location, last inspection date, inspection result, inspector ID, next inspection due date, regulation reference) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the safety inspection certification.
