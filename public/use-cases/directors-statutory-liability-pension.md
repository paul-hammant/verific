## What is Pension Trustee Insurance?

The people who manage a company's pension fund (the **Trustees**) are legally responsible for the employees' retirement money. If they make a bad investment or a mistake in the paperwork, they can be sued *personally*.

**Pension Trustee Liability (PTL)** insurance protects these individuals.

Because these claims can hit 20 years after a person retires, the paperwork must be permanent. Live Verify turns the static certificate in a trustee's home safe into a live, cryptographically trusted link back to the insurance carrier, ensuring they stay protected even decades later.

## Data Verified

Pension scheme name, individual trustee names, coverage limits (Indemnity), retention amount, ERISA/Statutory compliance status, retroactive date, issuing carrier, policy expiration.

**Document Types:**
- **Pension Trustee Liability (PTL) Certificate:** For annual board review.
- **Fiduciary Liability Policy:** The full legal contract.
- **Run-Off Endorsement:** Protecting retired trustees for 15+ years.
- **Regulatory Filing Summary:** (e.g., for UK Pensions Regulator or US Dept of Labor).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`axaxl.com`, `aig.com`) and current policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Premium paid; trustees protected.
- **Cancelled** — Coverage terminated (major risk for personal assets).
- **Run-Off** — Active for past acts only; no new acts covered.
- **Limit Depleted** — **ALERT:** Significant claims have reduced available protection.

## Second-Party Use

The **Pension Trustee** benefits from verification.

**Personal Asset Protection:** Trustees are personally liable for fiduciary breaches. A trustee can scan the "Verified Active" certificate to ensure the company hasn't quietly let the policy lapse to save cash, which would leave the trustee's personal house and bank account exposed to plan participants.

**Board Onboarding:** Proving to a potential new trustee that the fund has verified, high-limit insurance in place before they accept the role.

## Third-Party Use

**Pension Regulators (TPR / DoL)**
**Compliance Audit:** Ensuring that multi-billion dollar retirement funds are maintaining the mandatory fiduciary insurance required by law or best practice.

**Plan Participants (Employees)**
**Governance Transparency:** Employees can verify that the people managing their life savings are backed by a verified insurance policy from a top-tier carrier, increasing trust in the fund's management.

**External Auditors**
**Governance Review:** Verifying the "Internal Controls" of the pension fund by ensuring all fiduciary risks are properly insured.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Trustee Blindspot" Fraud Problem**

- **Insurance Lapsing:** A company entering financial distress "stopping" the PTL premium payments but hiding the cancellation from the trustees to prevent them from resigning.
- **Limit Tampering:** Editing a $1M "Small Business" policy to read $50M to satisfy a high-net-worth trustee's requirement.
- **Retroactive Date Erasure:** Editing the "Prior Acts" date to hide a period where the fund was uninsured or had a known breach.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Commercial Carriers:** (AXA XL, AIG, Chubb, Allianz).
**Fiduciary Benefit Managers.**
**Specialist PTL Brokers.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

AIG underwrites directors liability insurance for pension plan fiduciaries.

```
✓ directors.aig.co.uk/pension-liability/verify — Underwrites directors liability for pension issues
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK life insurance and pensions firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, coverage limits, policy effective and expiration dates, named trustees, coverage scope, policy status) — never trustee compensation or specific claims — providing non-repudiation of D&O or pension trustee liability coverage and an audit trail for regulatory compliance and long-tail liability protection.


## Competition vs. Annual Reports

| Feature | Live Verify | Pension Annual Report | PDF Scan of Policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds every trustee name. | **Vague.** Often just says "Insurance is in place." | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows if cancelled *today*. | **Historical.** Usually 6-12 months out of date. | **Static.** |
| **Detail** | **High.** Shows specific ERISA triggers. | **Low.** Minimal insurance detail. | **Full.** But untrusted. |
| **Archival** | **Permanent.** Durable for 20-year tail. | **Low.** Often discarded after 5 years. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Tail of Liability." Pension claims often arise decades after the trustee has retired. By then, the company might be gone. Live Verify turns the **Static Certificate** in the trustee's home safe into a permanent, cryptographically trusted link back to the carrier, ensuring protection even in the "Long Tail" of retirement.
