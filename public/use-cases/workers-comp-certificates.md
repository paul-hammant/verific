## What are Workers' Comp Certificates?

A **Workers' Compensation Certificate of Insurance (COI)** is the proof that a company has the mandatory insurance to pay for a worker's medical bills and lost wages after an on-the-job injury. These certificates are the "License to Work" for every contractor and sub-contractor on a job site.

Fraud is rampant in the construction industry. "Premium Evasion" is a multi-billion dollar problem: a contractor might "edit" a certificate to turn a 5-person policy into a 50-person policy to hide their true workforce size from the insurer. Similarly, they might use a fake certificate from a reputable carrier (like Liberty Mutual or Hartford) to bypass a general contractor's vetting process. Verified hashes bind the **FEIN Number, Employee Count, and Expiration Date** to the insurer's domain (e.g., `libertymutual.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, insurer name (NAIC), insured name, FEIN, policy effective/expiration dates, statutory limit status, employers liability limits (per accident/disease), payroll class codes (e.g., 5445 - Drywall), verified employee count, waiver of subrogation status, broker ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Workers' Comp:** (Form ACORD 25/SC) The primary proof.
- **Experience Rating Worksheet:** (Linked hash) proving the company's safety score (E-Mod).
- **Payroll Audit Summary:** Verification of workforce size.
- **Notice of Cancellation:** (Linked hash) sent if the policy lapses.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`libertymutual.com`, `travelers.com`, `statefund.org`) and the policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Verified** — Policy is current and premium-paid.
- **Cancelled** — **CRITICAL:** Coverage has ended (e.g., for non-payment); workers are un-protected.
- **Audit Pending** — **ALERT:** The company has failed to complete its mandatory payroll audit.
- **Ineligible** — **CRITICAL:** The policy does not cover the specific risk class (e.g., "Roofing").

## Second-Party Use

The **Employer / Contractor** benefits from verification.

**Site Entrance Speed:** When a sub-contractor's crew arrives at a high-security job site (e.g., a data center), they provide the verified hash of their insurance. The general contractor's gate guard can instantly see **"VERIFIED ACTIVE"** on their phone, allowing the crew to start work immediately without a 2-hour "COI Vetting" delay.

**Bid Credibility:** A small contractor can include verified insurance hashes in their bid package. "Verified by Liberty Mutual" ensures the client that the contractor is a professional firm that carries the required legal protection, distinguishing them from "un-insured cash" competitors.

## Third-Party Use

**General Contractors (GCs)**
**Liability Shield:** Thousands of fake COIs are used to hide un-insured labor on job sites. Live Verify connects the GC directly to the insurer's record, ensuring they won't be hit with a "Surprise Premium" audit for their sub-contractors' un-insured payroll.

**Injured Workers**
**Safety Verification:** A worker can scan the placard in the job trailer. Verification ensures that if they are hurt, there is a real, funded policy available to pay for their surgery and recovery, preventing "medical bankruptcy" caused by a fraudulent boss.

**State Insurance Commissions**
**Fraud Enforcement:** Verifying that the "Payroll" reported to the state matches the "Payroll" used to buy insurance, stopping the "Off-Book Labor" fraud that drains state insurance pools.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Policy" Fraud Problem**

- **Workforce Masking:** Buying a policy for "2 employees" but showing a PDF that says "20 employees" to get a contract.
- **Class Swapping:** Changing a high-risk "Roofing" class to a low-risk "Office Staff" class to lower the premium.
- **Date Stretching:** Using a policy that expired 6 months ago by changing the "2025" to "2026."

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Insurance Carriers.**
**State-Owned Workers' Comp Funds (e.g., NYSIF).**
**Lender Compliance Platforms (Insurance Tracking Services).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Individual employee counts and payroll figures are sensitive business data. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized general contractors and regulators.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Workers' compensation carriers must be licensed by state insurance regulators to provide mandatory workplace injury coverage.

```
✓ workerscomp.hartford.com/verify — Issues workers' compensation certificates
  ✓ insurance.ca.gov — Regulates insurance companies in California
    ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Workers' comp is the "Social Contract" of labor. By turning static COIs into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the livelihoods of workers and the capital of general contractors, ensuring that "Workplace Protection" is a cryptographic fact, not a paper fabrication.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, FEIN, employee count, effective/expiration dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the workers' compensation certificate.
