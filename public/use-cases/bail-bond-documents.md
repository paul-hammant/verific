## What is a Bail/Bond Document?

Someone posts bail. They walk out of jail with paperwork: the bail receipt, the conditions of release, the bond agreement. These documents control what the person can and cannot do while awaiting trial — where they can go, who they can contact, whether they can travel, whether they need electronic monitoring. The problem: who verifies these?

When the defendant shows up at the airport, the TSA agent has no way to know they're subject to a travel restriction. When the defendant's employer needs proof they posted bail and were released (not that they escaped), there's no verification. When a bail bondsman claims a bond was posted, the defendant's family has no way to verify the amount or terms without calling the court.

With Live Verify, bail and bond documents carry a verify line bound to the court's domain. Law enforcement, employers, bondsmen, and the defendant themselves can verify: real bail, real terms, currently in effect.

## Data Verified

Court name, case number, defendant name, bail amount, bond type (cash/surety/personal recognizance), conditions of release summary, posting date, bondsman name and license number (if surety bond).

**NOT included:** Details of underlying charges, evidence, victim names, witness information, or the probable cause affidavit.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a status code reflecting the bail/bond's current state:

- **ACTIVE** — Bail posted, conditions in effect, defendant released on these terms.
- **REVOKED** — Bail revoked by the court. Failure to appear, new charges, or violation of conditions. A bench warrant has been or will be issued.
- **FORFEITED** — Bond forfeited due to failure to appear. The bondsman owes the court the full bail amount.
- **MODIFIED** — Conditions changed by court order. The original document no longer reflects current terms. (A new verified document with updated conditions may be issued.)
- **EXONERATED** — Case resolved. Bail returned to depositor or bond discharged. The defendant's obligations under this bail order are concluded.
- **SURRENDERED** — Defendant surrendered by bondsman. The surety has revoked the bond and returned the defendant to custody.
- **404** — No matching record. The document is forged, the case number is wrong, or OCR failed.

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the bail document itself (e.g., `courts.maricopa.gov`).

## Second-Party Use

The **Defendant** — the person released on bail — benefits from verification.

**Proving release to employers.** The defendant was arrested, posted bail, and was released. Their employer needs to know they were legally released — not that they escaped. A verified bail document with ACTIVE status is proof of lawful release. Without it, the defendant's word is all they have, and their word isn't worth much right now.

**Proving conditions of release to landlords.** A condition of bail may require maintaining a current residence. The landlord wants to know whether the defendant is legally required to stay — and whether there are restrictions (like curfews or visitor limitations) that affect other tenants.

**Proving bail was posted to family members.** The defendant's family often pays the bondsman's premium. A verified bail document confirms the amount, the terms, and the bondsman's identity. No more taking the bondsman's word for the fee.

**Proving travel is permitted.** Some bail conditions allow travel for work or medical appointments with court approval. A verified document (or modified document reflecting the travel exception) proves the defendant is not violating conditions by being at the airport.

**Presenting to law enforcement during routine encounters.** The defendant is pulled over on a traffic stop. The officer runs their name and sees an active case. A verified bail document on their phone proves they are lawfully released, with conditions, under court supervision. This prevents unnecessary detentions and re-arrests.

## Third-Party Use

**Law Enforcement**
**Verifying release conditions during encounters.** An officer encounters the defendant 200 miles from their restricted area, or at the victim's workplace, or in possession of a firearm. A verified bail document tells the officer the exact conditions — and whether this encounter is a violation. Currently, officers call dispatch, dispatch calls the court, the court is closed. With Live Verify, the officer scans the document and knows in five seconds.

**Bail Bondsmen**
**Verifying bond status and tracking obligations.** Bondsmen need to know whether their bonds are still active, whether conditions have been modified, and whether the defendant has failed to appear (triggering forfeiture). A verified status of FORFEITED means the bondsman owes the court $25,000 and needs to find the defendant — fast.

**Employers**
**Confirming legal release.** An employer cannot fire someone solely for being arrested (in many jurisdictions). But they can — and do — question whether the employee is legally free. A verified ACTIVE bail document settles this without the employer calling the court.

**Pretrial Services Agencies**
**Monitoring compliance.** Pretrial services officers supervise defendants on bail. Verified documents confirm the conditions they're monitoring against. When the court modifies conditions, the MODIFIED status triggers a re-check of the updated terms.

**Defense Attorneys**
**Verifying terms for motions.** Defense attorneys file motions to modify bail conditions — reduce bail, remove travel restrictions, ease no-contact orders. A verified current document is the baseline for any modification motion.

**Victims and Victim Advocates**
**Verifying protective conditions.** No-contact orders are frequently part of bail conditions in domestic violence, stalking, and assault cases. The victim needs to know these conditions exist and are currently in effect. A verified bail document with ACTIVE status confirms the no-contact order is enforceable. REVOKED or MODIFIED status warns the victim that something has changed.

**Immigration Authorities**
**Bail conditions affecting immigration status.** A non-citizen on bail may face immigration consequences. ICE may issue a detainer. Verified bail documents clarify the criminal court's conditions, which immigration authorities need to understand before taking action.

## Verification Architecture — Bail Document Fraud

- **Fake bail receipts.** Claiming bail was posted when it wasn't. The defendant is still in custody — or was never arrested at all — but presents a fabricated bail receipt to an employer or family member. Returns 404.
- **Altered conditions.** The real bail document says "no travel outside Arizona." The altered version omits that line. The defendant presents the clean copy at the airport. Hash mismatch catches this instantly.
- **Forged bonds.** Fake bondsman documents. Someone claims to be a bail bondsman, collects a premium from the defendant's family, and produces a phony bond agreement. The court has no record. Returns 404.
- **Revoked bail presented as active.** The defendant violated conditions. The court revoked bail and issued a bench warrant. But the defendant still has the original bail document and presents it as current. Verification returns REVOKED — the document is real but the status has changed.
- **Interstate complications.** Defendant posts bail in Arizona, drives to California. California law enforcement encounters them. Is this person legally released? Are there travel restrictions? Without verification, the California officer has no way to check an Arizona court's records at 2 AM. With Live Verify, the Arizona court's domain responds regardless of geography or time zone.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

- **State Courts** — Superior courts, district courts, municipal courts issuing bail orders
- **Federal Courts** — U.S. District Courts setting bail/bond conditions for federal charges
- **Bail Bondsmen** — Licensed surety agents issuing bond agreements (regulated as insurance in most states)
- **Pretrial Services Agencies** — Government agencies managing supervised release programs

## Privacy Salt

High sensitivity. The existence of a bail document reveals that a person has been charged with a crime. Salt is essential to prevent enumeration attacks. Without salt, an adversary who knows a person's name could hash plausible case number combinations and probe the endpoint, discovering whether someone has been arrested and released on bail — even without possessing the document. The salt makes this computationally infeasible.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

UK courts issue bail orders and conditions of release authorized by the Bail Act 1976 and criminal procedure codes.

```
✓ courts.gov.uk/bail/verify — UK courts issuing bail orders and release conditions
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition

| Feature | Live Verify | Court Case Lookup Portals | Calling the Court Clerk | NCIC / Law Enforcement Databases | Trusting the Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Who can access** | **Anyone with the document.** Defendant, employer, bondsman, law enforcement, victim. | **Public** (where available). But fragmented — every county has a different system. | **Anyone.** But requires knowing which court, which case number, and reaching the right clerk. | **Law enforcement only.** Not accessible to civilians, employers, bondsmen, or victims. | **Anyone.** No verification at all. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Navigate unfamiliar portal, search by name or case number, hope the data is current. | **Slow.** Minutes to hours. After-hours impossible. Courts close at 5 PM; bail is posted at 3 AM. | **Fast** — for officers. Seconds within the system. | **Instant.** Zero-second "verification." |
| **Real-time status** | **Yes.** ACTIVE, REVOKED, FORFEITED — reflects current court record. | **Lagging.** Many portals update daily or weekly, not in real time. | **Yes** — if you reach the clerk. | **Yes** — within the system. | **No.** Paper doesn't update itself. |
| **After-hours** | **24/7.** Hash lookup is always available. | **24/7** (if the portal is up). But data may be stale. | **No.** Courts close. Bail is a 24/7 problem. | **24/7** for officers only. | **N/A.** |
| **Interstate** | **Works.** Domain-based, no system integration needed. Arizona court responds to California query. | **Fails.** You need to know which county in which state to search. | **Fails.** You need to know which court to call. | **Partial.** NCIC has warrants but not bail conditions. | **Fails.** No way to authenticate another state's documents. |
| **Detects forgery** | **Yes.** Hash mismatch = forgery. 404 = fabrication. | **Partial.** You can compare details, but altered conditions won't be caught if you don't know the original. | **Yes** (if you reach the clerk). | **Yes** (within the system). | **No.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Court case lookup portals exist but they're a patchwork — different system for every county, often behind paywalls, rarely real-time. NCIC is powerful but locked behind a law enforcement badge. The people who most need bail verification outside the system — employers deciding whether to fire someone, victims checking whether a no-contact order is still in effect, families verifying what the bondsman told them, defendants proving to a traffic cop that they're legally free — have no practical access to any of these. Live Verify puts verification in the hands of anyone holding the document, 24/7, across state lines.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the bail bond issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the bail bond document.
## Further Derivations

1. **Pretrial supervision documents** — Electronic monitoring agreements, drug testing schedules, curfew orders, check-in requirements, GPS ankle bracelet terms. These are the ongoing compliance documents that flow from bail conditions. The bail order sets the rules; pretrial supervision documents are the operational implementation. Each carries its own verify line bound to the pretrial services agency's domain (e.g., `pretrial.maricopa.gov/v`), creating a verifiable chain from court order through supervision compliance. When a defendant's GPS monitor shows them at the victim's address, the supervision document proves the no-contact condition existed and was communicated.
