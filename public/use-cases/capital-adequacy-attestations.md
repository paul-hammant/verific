## What is a Capital Adequacy Attestation?

In the banking and insurance sectors, **Capital Adequacy** is the measure of a firm's "Safety Buffer." It defines the amount of liquid capital a firm must hold to absorb unexpected losses. A **Capital Adequacy Attestation** is a formal document, usually signed by the CFO and an external auditor, proving the firm meets the minimum regulatory requirements (e.g., Basel III CET1 ratios).

These documents are the "Proof of Solvency" needed for high-stakes business. Counterparties (other banks) and large institutional clients demand these attestations before entering into multi-billion dollar derivative or custody contracts. Fraud is high-stakes: a struggling firm might "edit" a ratio from 7% (critically low) to 12% (healthy) to prevent a "run on the bank" or to secure a partnership. Verified hashes bind the **CET1 Ratio, Buffer Compliance, and Auditor's Signature** to the firm's or the regulator's domain.

## Data Verified

Firm name, regulatory ID (FRN/CRD), attestation date (quarterly), CET1 Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Total Capital Ratio, LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio), buffer compliance status, CFO name/signature, external auditor name/ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Capital Adequacy Attestation:** The primary quarterly summary.
- **Pillar 3 Disclosure:** (Linked hash) the public transparency report.
- **ICAAP Summary:** The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment.
- **Auditor's Comfort Letter:** Proof the math was independently checked.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`meridian-capital.com`, `gs.com`, `fca.org.uk`) and the solvency standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Confirmed / Compliant** — Ratios match the firm's certified regulatory filing.
- **Superseded** — **ALERT:** A newer quarterly attestation is available.
- **Breach Alert** — **CRITICAL:** The firm has reported a capital buffer breach to the regulator.
- **Under Review** — **ALERT:** The reported ratios are subject to a regulatory audit.

## Second-Party Use

The **Firm's Treasury / Compliance Dept** benefits from verification.

**Counterparty Trust:** When entering a $100M currency swap with another bank, the Treasury team provides the verified "Capital Hash." The counterparty can instantly see **"VERIFIED 14.2% CET1"** on their phone, removing the "Counterparty Risk" fear and allowing the trade to execute without a 2-day manual credit review.

**Investor Relations:** Providing verified hashes of solvency data to large institutional investors (Pension Funds) to maintain "Investment Grade" trust during market volatility.

## Third-Party Use

**Counterparty Banks / Clearing Houses**
**Credit Limit Setting:** Automatically monitoring the verified capital hashes of all 50 partner banks in a trading network. If a partner's hash returns **"BREACH ALERT,"** the system can instantly freeze their credit lines to prevent systemic contagion.

**Regulatory Auditors**
**Integrity Audit:** During a routine exam, the regulator scans the attestations provided to clients. Live Verify ensures the bank isn't "Providing higher ratios to clients" than they are "Reporting to the Regulator."

**Corporate Clients**
**Custody Vetting:** Before depositing $500M in a custody account, a corporate treasurer verifies the bank's capital adequacy hash to ensure the funds are being held by a stable, well-capitalized institution.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Window Dressing" Fraud Problem**

- **Ratio Inflation:** Manually editing a "7.5%" ratio to "12.5%" on a PDF to bypass a counterparty's minimum threshold.
- **Buffer Masking:** Removing a footnote that mentions a "temporary capital waiver" granted by the regulator.
- **Stale Data:** Presenting a "Healthy" Q1 attestation in Q3 after a major market loss has wiped out the capital.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Investment Banks.**
**Prudential Regulators (Fed, PRA, ECB).**
**Audit Firms (Big 4).**

**Privacy Salt:** Highly Critical. Exact capital amounts and internal buffer strategies are highly sensitive "Market-Moving" data. The hash must be salted and access restricted to authorized financial institutions.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Barclays issues capital adequacy compliance attestations for UK banking regulations.

```
✓ compliance.barclays.co.uk/capital/verify — Issues capital adequacy compliance attestations
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK financial services governance
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Capital adequacy is the "Foundation of Financial Stability." By turning technical attestations into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the banking system from the "Minsky Moment" of hidden insolvency and ensure that "Safety" is backed by cryptographic proof.

## Jurisdictional Equivalents

| | UK | US | EU |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Authority** | PRA (Bank of England) | Federal Reserve / OCC / FDIC | ECB/SSM (Single Supervisory Mechanism) + national regulators |
| **Document** | Capital adequacy attestation | Capital adequacy attestation | Capital adequacy attestation |
| **Legal basis** | CRD IV/V; Basel III implemented via PRA rulebook | Dodd-Frank Act; US capital rules (Basel III implementation) | CRD IV/V + CRR (Capital Requirements Regulation) |
| **Potential verify: domain** | `prudentialregulation.bankofengland.co.uk` | `federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg` | `bankingsupervision.europa.eu` (varies by state) |
| **Key difference** | PRA applies Basel III with UK-specific buffers; dual-regulated firms also answer to FCA | Three federal agencies (Fed, OCC, FDIC) plus state regulators; Basel III "endgame" rules subject to US rulemaking | ECB directly supervises significant institutions; national regulators handle less significant ones; CRR is directly applicable EU law |

**Further Jurisdictional Peers**

- **Australia:** APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) — Basel III implemented via APS (Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Prudential Standards). Known for conservative "unquestionably strong" capital benchmarks.
- **Canada:** OSFI (Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions) — Basel III via CAR Guideline (Capital Adequacy Requirements). Canadian banks consistently among the best-capitalised globally.
- **Singapore:** MAS — Basel III via MAS Notice 637. Singapore applies Basel standards with additional domestic buffers for systemically important banks.
- **Japan:** FSA/JFSA — Basel III via local capital adequacy requirements. Japan's megabanks subject to G-SIB surcharges.
- **Switzerland:** FINMA — Basel III, often with a "Swiss finish" imposing higher requirements than the Basel minimum, particularly for UBS and Credit Suisse (now UBS).
- **Hong Kong:** HKMA — Basel III via Banking (Capital) Rules. Hong Kong typically implements Basel standards ahead of schedule.

**Market Abuse & Insider Trading**

Falsifying capital adequacy ratios is a form of market manipulation — it misleads investors, counterparties, and regulators about a firm's solvency. "Window dressing" capital positions at quarter-end is a known abuse pattern.

- **UK:** Market Abuse Regulation (UK MAR, retained EU law) — misleading statements about capital position can constitute market manipulation under Art. 12; FCA has enforcement powers under FSMA 2000 s.118; Criminal Justice Act 1993 for criminal insider dealing
- **US:** SEC Rule 10b-5 (anti-fraud); Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 (SOX) s.302/906 — CEO/CFO must personally certify financial statements including capital ratios; false certification is a federal crime (up to 20 years); Dodd-Frank Act whistleblower provisions
- **EU:** Market Abuse Regulation (MAR, Regulation 596/2014) + Market Abuse Directive II (MAD II, Directive 2014/57/EU) — criminal sanctions for market manipulation; ESMA coordinates enforcement across member states
- **Australia:** ASIC enforces market integrity under Corporations Act 2001 Part 7.10; continuous disclosure obligations (ASX Listing Rules) mean capital adequacy issues must be disclosed promptly
- **Canada:** Provincial securities regulators (OSC, AMF, BCSC); Criminal Code s.380 (fraud) and s.382 (market manipulation); CSA (Canadian Securities Administrators) coordinates nationally
- **Singapore:** Securities and Futures Act (SFA) Part XII — market manipulation and insider trading; MAS and SGX enforce; criminal penalties up to 7 years / SGD 250,000
- **Japan:** Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA) — insider trading (Art. 166-167), market manipulation (Art. 159); SESC (Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission) investigates, FSA enforces
- **Hong Kong:** Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) Part XIII/XIV — market misconduct; SFC and Market Misconduct Tribunal; dual civil/criminal enforcement track
- **Switzerland:** Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FMIA) — insider trading and market manipulation; FINMA enforcement; Criminal Code Art. 161 (repealed, now in FMIA)

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the attestation it issued.
