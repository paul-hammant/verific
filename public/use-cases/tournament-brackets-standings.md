## What are Tournament Brackets?

In competitive sports and eSports, the **Tournament Bracket** is the official map of victory and defeat. It determines who advanced to the finals and who was eliminated in the first round. **Official Standings** are the season-long records that determine "Ranking" and "Seeding" for the next championship.

These documents are the "Career Proof" for athletes and teams. They are used to secure **Sponsorships**, **College Recruitment**, and **Pro Draft** slots. Fraud is common in junior and amateur levels: players or coaches often "edit" a bracket to show they finished in the "Top 4" instead of the "Top 32," or to hide a loss against a weak opponent. Verified hashes bind the **Match Results, Player/Team Names, and Final Rankings** to the league's domain (e.g., `ncaa.com`, `fifa.com`, or `challengermode.com`).

## Data Verified

Tournament name, division/tier, season/date, participant/team names, seeds/rankings, individual match scores, final placement (Champion/Runner-up), head official name, protest status.

**Document Types:**
- **Championship Bracket:** The visual map of the single-elimination play.
- **Season Standings:** The table showing wins, losses, and points.
- **Participation Certificate:** Proving an athlete was part of the event.
- **Match Scorecard:** Detailed data for a single specific game.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ncaa.org`, `espn.com`, `start.gg`) and the result standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Official / Final** — Results are verified and the appeal period has closed.
- **Provisional** — Results are recorded but subject to final audit or drug test.
- **Vacated** — **ALERT:** Results have been overturned (e.g., due to cheating or eligibility fraud).
- **In Dispute** — **ALERT:** A formal protest is active for this match/bracket.

## Second-Party Use

The **Athlete / Team Captain** benefits from verification.

**Sponsorship Scouting:** A semi-pro team can include a verified "Season Standings Hash" in their pitch to a brand (e.g., Red Bull). The brand can instantly see **"VERIFIED #1 SEED - ELITE SERIES"** on their phone, removing the doubt that the team is "Exaggerating" their popularity or skill.

**Scholarship Applications:** A student-athlete can include a verified bracket in their NCAA recruitment portal. "Verified by Elite Champs" ensures the college coach that the player actually won the state finals and isn't just taking credit for a teammate's performance.

## Third-Party Use

**Sports Media / Journalists**
**Record Accuracy:** When writing a "Where are they now?" story, a journalist can scan a 10-year-old verified bracket to ensure they are accurately reporting the career history of a retired athlete.

**College Admissions / Recruiters**
**Eligibility Vetting:** Verifying that a "State Champion" claim matches the official league records, protecting the integrity of athletic scholarships.

**Betting & Integrity Units**
**Fraud Investigation:** Verifying that the "Official Score" on the paper matches the digital result to prevent "Result Tampering" in leagues with heavy betting volume.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Photoshopped Trophy" Fraud Problem**

- **Placement Inflation:** Changing a "Quarter-Finalist" label to "Winner" on a certificate.
- **Score Padding:** Editing a close 1-0 loss into a 2-1 win to improve a team's goal-differential ranking.
- **Name Swapping:** Putting a different player's name on a real championship bracket.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**National Governing Bodies (NGBs).**
**Amateur Athletic Unions (AAU).**
**Digital Tournament Platforms (e.g., Smash.gg, Battlefy).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low. Tournament results are usually public. However, individual player IDs should be salted to protect the privacy of youth athletes.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues tournament bracket standings

```
✓ brackets.itftennis.com/verify — Issues tournament bracket standings
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Sports results are "Competitive History." By turning brackets into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that the rewards of victory—glory, scholarships, and contracts—go to those who actually won the game.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive tournament organizers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (tournament name, division/tier, season/date, participant/team names, seeds/rankings, individual match scores, final placement, head official name, protest status) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the tournament bracket.
