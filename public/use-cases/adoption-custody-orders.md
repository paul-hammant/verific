## What is a Custody Order?

A **Custody Order** (or Allocation Judgment) is a court decree defining who is responsible for a child. It answers critical questions:
1.  **Who decides?** (School, Doctor, Religion)
2.  **Who has the child when?** (Weekends, Holidays)
3.  **Are there restrictions?** (No leaving the state, supervised visits only)

These documents are presented to schools, police, doctors, and passport agents. The problem is that parents often present **outdated orders** to authorities to override the other parent's rights.

## Data Verified

Child's name, parents' names, court jurisdiction, case number, judge name, order type (custody, adoption, visitation), effective date, key restrictions (e.g., "no international travel").

**Document Types:**
- **Adoption Decree:** Finalizing legal parentage.
- **Allocation Judgment:** Modern term for "custody order" detailing decision-making and parenting time.
- **Order of Protection:** Restraining orders affecting custody.
- **Letters of Guardianship:** For non-parent legal guardians.

**Privacy and Salt:** Given the extreme sensitivity of child records, the hash MUST use a high-entropy random salt (printed on the document) to prevent "brute force guessing" of hashes to find children's names.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., `cookcountycourt.org`) and the order status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Order is current and the latest on file.
- **Modified** — Superseded by a more recent court order (critical for custody disputes).
- **Vacated** — Order is no longer in effect.

## Second-Party Use

The **Custodial Parent** or **Adoptive Parent** benefits from verification.

**School Enrollment:** Proving to a school registrar that they have the sole authority to enroll the child and designate emergency contacts.

**International Travel:** Proving to border agents (CBP) that they have the sole right to travel with the child, or that the other parent has consented (preventing international abduction accusations).

**Healthcare Decisions:** Proving to a hospital that they have decision-making power for the child's surgery.

## Third-Party Use

**Schools**
**Enrollment Integrity:** Schools often face "parent wars" where one parent tries to override the other's instructions. A verified, current court order definitively settles who has decision-making power.

**Doctors and Hospitals**
**Consent Validity:** Before performing non-emergency procedures, doctors need to know if the presenting parent actually has the legal right to consent, especially in divorced families.

**Police**
**Domestic Disputes:** When called to a "custody dispute" at a handover location, police are often shown conflicting paper orders by shouting parents. Scanning the QR/text to see "Status: MODIFIED - See Order dated Nov 2025" allows officers to enforce the *current* order instantly.

**Passport Agencies**
**Passport Issuance:** The State Department requires proof of sole custody or two-parent consent. Verification prevents one parent from fraudulently obtaining a passport for a child.

## Verification Architecture

**The Custody Fraud Problem**

- **Outdated Orders:** The most common issue. A parent presents the 2023 order giving them full custody, hiding the 2025 order that switched custody to the other parent.
- **Forgery:** Photoshop is easily used to remove "Supervised Visitation Only" restrictions.
- **Jurisdiction Shopping:** Presenting an order from another state that has been superseded by the home state's court.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Circuit/Family Courts:** The primary issuers.
**Probate Courts:** For guardianships.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Example authority chains by jurisdiction:

**US example (matching the sample artifact above):**

```
✓ cookcountycourt.org/orders/v — Issues Cook County family court orders
  ✓ illinoiscourts.gov — Illinois judicial authority
    ✓ illinois.gov — Illinois state government root namespace
```

**UK variant:**

```
✓ courts.gov.uk/family/verify — Issues UK custody and adoption orders
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the court's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the order.


## Critical Freshness Warning

**⚠️ Custody orders change frequently.** Unlike most verified documents, custody orders can be modified, superseded, or vacated by subsequent court rulings — sometimes within days of the original order.

**The freshness problem:**
- A "VALID" status means the hash matches *and* the order hasn't been superseded
- Courts must update verification status in real-time when new orders are entered
- Stale data is dangerous — a parent could present a verified order that was modified yesterday

**Live Verify is a bridge technology here.** This is only a strong use case where the court can maintain real-time status. The ideal solution is live court integration where police, schools, and hospitals can query the case number directly for the *current* order. Until courts build those APIs, Live Verify provides a partial solution — but only if:
1. Courts commit to updating verification status immediately when orders change
2. Verifiers understand "VALID" means "as of this moment" — not "forever"
3. The `MODIFIED` status is treated as "do not enforce; obtain current order"

**If a court cannot guarantee real-time status updates, this use case may create false confidence.**

## Competition vs. Certified Copies

| Feature | Live Verify | Certified Copy (Raised Seal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Can indicate if the order was modified yesterday. | **Static.** Only proves the order existed *on the day the copy was printed*. |
| **Accessibility** | **Instant.** Police/Schools can verify on the spot. | **Slow.** Requires calling the court clerk (often impossible) to check validity. |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Self-service. | **High.** Certified copies cost money and require trips to the courthouse. |
| **Tamper Proofing** | **Cryptographic.** Hash breaks if text changes. | **Physical.** Raised seals are hard to forge but not impossible; colored paper can be photocopied. |

**Why OCR is a bridge solution:** The "freshness" problem is massive in family law. A paper "Certified Copy" from 6 months ago is dangerous because it doesn't show that the judge stripped custody last week. A live verification link to the court record prevents the enforcement of stale/dangerous orders — *but only if the court maintains real-time status updates*. Long-term, direct court API integration is the better answer.
