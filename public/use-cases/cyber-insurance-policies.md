## What is Cyber Insurance?

If a company is hacked and customer data is stolen, they can be sued for millions. **Cyber Insurance** covers these legal fees, government fines, and the cost of "breach response" (like mailing notices to customers).

Large corporations (like Apple or Walmart) require all their vendors to have verified cyber insurance policies.

Fraudsters often "Photoshop" a low-limit policy ($100k) to look like a $10M policy to win big contracts. Live Verify allows a procurement officer to scan the vendor's policy and see the **true limits** on the insurer's domain instantly.

## Data Verified

Named insured, industry class code, specific coverage module limits (Liability, Response, Extortion), business interruption daily limit, effective/expiration dates, security warrants (e.g., "MFA active"), issuing carrier.

**Document Types:**
- **Policy Declarations:** The 1-page summary required by partners.
- **Forensic Case Report:** Summary of a verified breach investigation.
- **Remediation Certification:** Proving that security gaps were fixed post-breach.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`aetna.com`, `chubb.com`, `aig.com`) and current policy status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Premium paid; coverage in force.
- **Restricted** — Coverage limited due to safety/security non-compliance.
- **Cancelled** — Policy terminated (e.g., for misrepresentation of security posture).
- **Claim Active** — Incident response currently being funded.

## Second-Party Use

The **Insured Business** (second party) receives the policy from the insurer (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the coverage terms. Most of the time, the policy sits in their business records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the policy matches what the insurer's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a cyber incident occurs or a dispute arises about coverage, they have cryptographic proof of the policy terms ready without needing to contact the insurer.

## Third-Party Use

The insured business (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Enterprise Procurement Teams**
**Vendor Vetting:** Procurement officers scan the COI/Dec Page of every vendor who has access to their data. "Verified by AIG" ensures the vendor isn't using a "Photoshopped" high-limit policy to hide their actual low-limit coverage.

**Banks / Lenders**
**Loan Compliance:** Verifying that a tech-heavy borrower has adequate cyber insurance to survive a ransomware attack, protecting the bank's repayment source.

**Regulators (State Insurance Depts)**
**Market Oversight:** Ensuring carriers are accurately reporting their "Cyber Exposure" totals by verifying the hashes of issued policies.

## Verification Architecture

**The "MFA Misrepresentation" Fraud Problem**

- **Warrant Falsification:** A company editing their policy PDF to hide the fact that the insurer *excluded* coverage because the company didn't have MFA.
- **Ghost Policies:** Buying a policy, printing the papers, then cancelling it immediately to bypass vendor security requirements.
- **Limit Inflation:** Changing a $1M "Incident Response" limit to $10M to win a prestigious tech contract.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Global Cyber Carriers (AIG, Beazley, Chubb, Travelers)
- Cyber Insurtechs (Coalition, At-Bay, Corvus)
- Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs - who often co-sign the security warrants)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Cyber insurance policies often contain enumerable values—round dollar coverage limits ($1M, $5M, $10M), standard retention amounts, and publicly known company names. A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a company's cyber risk profile and coverage strategy, gaining unfair market intelligence. Salt protects these strategic business decisions.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Beazley underwrites cyber liability and data breach insurance for global enterprises.

```
✓ cyber.beazley.com/verify — Underwrites cyber liability and data breach insurance
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the insurer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, coverage limits, policy period, issue date, industry codes) — never company names, system details, or breach history — providing non-repudiation of the cyber insurance policy issuance and immutable proof of coverage terms critical for breach disputes.

## Competition vs. Automated Security Scans (Bitsight)

| Feature | Live Verify | Security Rating (Bitsight/SecurityScorecard) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds the Financials.** Proves the *Money* exists. | **Binds the Tech.** Measures the *Security Score*. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Insurer. | **Platform-Bound.** Trust the scanner algorithm. | **Visual.** |
| **Context** | **Legal.** Shows the actual contract limits. | **Predictive.** Guesses the risk from the outside. | **Full.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Queries the carrier's live file. | **Weekly/Monthly.** Scans take time to refresh. | **Static.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Contractual Reality." A Bitsight score says a company *looks* safe. A verified insurance policy says the company *is backed by $10M in cash* if they aren't safe. Live Verify turns the **Financial Contract** into a verifiable digital artifact that is much more important for legal liability than a technical "Security Score."
