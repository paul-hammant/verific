## Data Verified

Seller (client) name, Buyer (debtor) name, Invoice number, total invoice amount, advance rate %, cash advance amount, factor fee structure, date of purchase, notice of assignment (remit-to) bank details.

**Document Types:**
- **Factoring Confirmation:** The "Receipt" for the cash advance.
- **Notice of Assignment (NOA):** The legal letter sent to the buyer.
- **Verification of Debt (VOD):** (Linked hash) where the buyer confirms the invoice is real.
- **UCC-1 Filing Extract:** Proving the factor's legal lien on the assets.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`bluevine.com`, `fundbox.com`) and current asset status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Advanced** — Factor has purchased the invoice and paid the seller.
- **Paid** — Buyer has settled the invoice with the factor.
- **In-Dispute** — Buyer has challenged the goods/invoice quality.
- **Void** — Transaction reversed; seller repurchased the invoice.

## Second-Party Use

The **Seller (Small Business)** benefits from verification.

**Line of Credit Extension:** Proving to their primary bank that their "Accounts Receivable" are verified assets that have already been vetted by a major factoring firm. This allows the business to get higher credit limits by demonstrating a "Verified Liquid" balance sheet.

**Vendor Assurance:** Proving to a raw material supplier that they have the verified "Cash Advance" coming, ensuring the supplier continues to ship the next batch of parts.

## Third-Party Use

**The Debtor (Buyer's Accounts Payable)**
**Remit-to Integrity:** When a buyer receives a "Notice of Assignment" telling them to pay a different bank, they are often terrified of wire fraud. Live Verify allows the AP clerk to verify the NOA against the Factor's domain. "Verified by BlueVine" ensures the buyer isn't paying a hacker.

**Alternative Lenders**
**Lien Vetting:** Ensuring that an invoice isn't being "Double Factored" (sold to two different firms). A verified hash proves who currently owns the legal right to the cash.

**External Auditors**
**Existence of Assets:** Verifying the "Advance Rate" and "Reserve Fund" totals during a corporate audit.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Double Factoring" Fraud Problem**

- **Double-Financing:** A dishonest seller selling the same $100,000 invoice to two different factoring companies. Live Verify allows factors to check the hash status of an invoice ID across a shared (or individual) domain index.
- **Amount Inflation:** Editing a $10,000 invoice PDF to read $100,000 to get a larger cash advance.
- **Fake NOAs:** Hackers creating fake assignment letters to redirect payments from a legitimate factor to a private criminal wallet.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Fintech Factors:** (BlueVine, Fundbox, FundThrough).
**Commercial Banks.**
**UCC-1 Registries:** (Hosting the verified lien hashes).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Close Brothers, a regulated financial services firm, is authorized by the FCA to issue verified invoice financing and factoring agreements.

```
✓ factoring.closebrothers.co.uk/verify — Issues verified invoice financing and factoring confirmations
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK trade finance providers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the factor's or financing company's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of issuing the invoice assignment.

## Competition vs. Manual VOD Calls

| Feature | Live Verify | Manual VOD (Phone/Email) | Scanned PDF NOA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Factor. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering or "fake buyers." | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Often takes 3-5 days to reach the buyer's AP manager. | **Instant.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Bank Details*. | **Vague.** "Yes, we will pay that invoice." | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Share only the *NOA*. | **Low.** Calls reveal the seller's cash situation. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Wire Fraud" reality. Accounts Payable clerks are being trained to **ignore** email-based bank detail changes. They demand "Independent Verification." Live Verify turns the **Assignment Letter** into a live, high-authority digital proof that allows the buyer to pay the factor with 100% confidence.
