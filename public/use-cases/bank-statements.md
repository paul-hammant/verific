## What is a Bank Statement?

A **Bank Statement** is the ultimate proof of wealth. It shows exactly how much money you have and where it came from.

Lenders use them to approve mortgages. Governments use them to approve Visas. Fraudsters use "Inspect Element" or Photoshop to turn a $500 balance into $50,000 in seconds.

Verifying a bank statement directly against the bank's domain ensures that the balance on the page is the **truth**, without forcing the user to give their bank password to a risky "data scraping" app.

## Data Verified

The full visible text of the **verified page** — account holder name, account number (masked), the summary block (balances, deposits, withdrawals, statement date range, issuing entity), **and the transaction rows on that page**. This is [page-at-a-time hashing](../../docs/page-at-a-time-hashing.md): the verifiable unit is one rendered page, so a deleted withdrawal or inserted deposit *on a page you check* changes that page's hash and fails to verify — not just the summary balance. A multi-page statement has one hash per page.

**Reliability depends on how the page is read.** In Chrome-extension mode (DOM text, no OCR) and future PDF mode (text-layer extraction), a full page of dense rows hashes deterministically — this is the strong path, and the one to prefer for a presented statement. Camera-OCR on a *printed* dense page is more fragile: every misread row breaks the page hash, so on paper the reliable unit may fall back to the summary block. The app should tell the verifier which was checked, never imply the rows were verified when OCR couldn't read them.

**The "removed page" caveat.** Verifying the pages you are *shown* does not prove you were shown *all* of them — a fraudster could present pages 1, 2, and 4 and omit page 3. Where completeness matters (as in KYC), the optional `compositeHash` manifest reports `thisPage` / `totalPages`, so a missing page is detectable. See [page-at-a-time hashing](../../docs/page-at-a-time-hashing.md).

**Document Types:**
- **Monthly Account Statement:** Standard retail/commercial proof.
- **Verification of Deposit (VOD):** 1-page summary for lenders.
- **Transaction Receipt:** For high-value wires or transfers.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`chase.com`, `wellsfargo.com`) and the account standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Statement content matches the bank's snapshot.
- **Amended** — A correction was issued for this period.
- **Inactive** — Account has been closed since this statement was issued.

## Second-Party Use

The **Bank Customer** benefits from verification.

**Mortgage Applications:** Proving to a lender that the $1.5M balance isn't a "Photoshopped PDF" but is a verified asset. This speeds up the "Pre-Approval" process significantly.

**Business Partnerships:** Proving financial liquidity to a new supplier or partner without giving them direct login access to the bank account.

**Dispute Resolution:** If a transaction is "missing" from the bank's internal record later, the verified statement serves as cryptographic proof of what the bank previously attested to.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Underwriters**
**Asset Verification:** Lenders currently use manual "bank login" scrapers (like Plaid) which many users find invasive. Live Verify allows the user to simply send a PDF/Paper statement that the lender can trust without needing the user's password.

**Regulators (The Fed / FDIC)**
**Systemic Audit:** Regulators receiving a feed of statement hashes can verify that the bank isn't "running two sets of books" (i.e., telling the customer they have $1M but telling the regulator they only have $100k).

**M&A Due Diligence**
**Liquidity Verification:** Buyers in a corporate acquisition can instantly verify the target company's cash-on-hand claims by scanning recent statements.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Photoshopped Balance" Fraud Problem**

- **Balance Inflation:** Changing a $5,000 balance to $50,000 to qualify for a loan.
- **Transaction Deletion:** Removing a large "Gambling Withdrawal" or "IRS Penalty" from the statement before sending it to a landlord.
- **Fabricated Statements:** Using a realistic-looking template to create a statement for a non-existent account at a real bank.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Retail Banks:** (Chase, BofA, HSBC).
**Neobanks:** (Revolut, Monzo, Chime).
**Brokerage Firms:** (Schwab, Fidelity).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

```
✓ statements.hsbc.co.uk/verify — Provides retail and commercial banking in the UK
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK banks and deposit-takers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the bank's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (account number, statement period, balance) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.

## Competition vs. Open Banking (Plaid/Finicity)

| Feature | Live Verify | Open Banking (Plaid) | Paper / Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Privacy** | **High.** No passwords shared. No data scraping. | **Low.** Requires bank password; scrapes full history. | **Medium.** But untrusted. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Every line is protected. | **High.** Direct API access. | **Zero.** Easily edited. |
| **User Control** | **High.** User chooses which statement to share. | **Low.** Once linked, the app has continuous access. | **High.** |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Works for any bank with a domain. | **Limited.** Only works for banks on the Plaid network. | **Manual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Trust without Intrusion. Many high-net-worth individuals and privacy-conscious users refuse to give their bank passwords to third-party "scrapers." Live Verify provides the **same level of trust** as an API, but preserves the user's security and privacy.
