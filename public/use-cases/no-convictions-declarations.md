## What is a No Convictions Declaration?

A no convictions declaration (also called a certificate of good standing, good character certificate, or police clearance) is an affirmative statement that an individual has no criminal convictions, or no relevant convictions within a specified scope. Unlike background check results that report findings, these are declarative certificates used for licensing, immigration, and employment.

These certificates are high-value fraud targets. A fake "no convictions" certificate can enable someone with disqualifying convictions to obtain licenses, visas, or positions they're ineligible for.

## Data Verified

Issuing authority, applicant/holder name, certificate/license number, scope of certification, specific disqualifying categories checked, certification date, validity period.

**Document Types:**
- **Driving Certification:** No disqualifying driving offenses.
- **Childcare Clearance:** No prohibiting offenses for working with children.
- **Security License:** No objection to security industry employment.
- **Financial Industry Check:** No regulatory disclosures or complaints.
- **Healthcare Worker Clearance:** No patient abuse or professional misconduct.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dmv.ca.gov`, `finra.org`) and certification status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Clear** — No disqualifying conditions found.
- **Conditional** — Cleared with limitations or conditions.
- **Expired** — Validity period has passed.
- **Revoked** — Clearance withdrawn due to new information.
- **Under Review** — Status being reassessed.

## Second-Party Use

The **Applicant/Worker** benefits from verification.

**Job Applications:** Workers in regulated industries (childcare, healthcare, finance, security) need verified clearances to prove eligibility.

**License Renewals:** Professionals renewing licenses can provide verified clearances to expedite processing.

**Immigration:** Some visa categories require character certificates. Verified declarations satisfy consular requirements.

**Volunteer Positions:** Youth organizations require verified clearances for volunteers.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers**
**Hiring Compliance:** Employers in regulated industries must verify worker clearances. Verified declarations provide documentary proof for compliance audits.

**Licensing Boards**
**Application Processing:** Boards verify that applicant-submitted clearances are genuine before issuing licenses.

**Regulatory Agencies**
**Supervision:** Agencies supervising regulated industries verify ongoing clearance status of licensees.

**Schools / Youth Organizations**
**Volunteer Screening:** Verify that volunteer-submitted clearances are authentic.

**Insurance Companies**
**Underwriting:** Verify clearances before issuing professional liability coverage.

## Verification Architecture

**The No Convictions Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Certificates:** Entirely fake clearance documents.
- **Scope Misrepresentation:** Narrow clearances presented as comprehensive.
- **Expired Clearances:** Old certificates presented as current.
- **Identity Fraud:** Someone else's clearance used with altered name.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Agencies:** (DMV, DHS, licensing boards) issue specialized clearances.
**Federal Agencies:** (FBI, TSA, FINRA) federal-level clearances.
**Professional Regulators:** Industry-specific regulatory bodies.
**International:** National police services issuing character certificates.

**Continuous Monitoring**

Some clearances (e.g., FINRA, TSA PreCheck) involve continuous monitoring. The verification hash represents status as of a point in time; verifiers should note the date and understand that status can change.

**Scope Clarity**

Different clearances check different things. A childcare clearance checks specific offenses related to child welfare. A driving certification checks driving-related offenses. Verified clearances should clearly indicate their scope so verifiers understand what was and wasn't checked.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

The UK Disclosure and Barring Service issues basic disclosure certificates with no convictions declarations under the Police Act 1997.

```
✓ disclosure.dbs.gov.uk/basic/verify — UK DBS basic disclosure and no convictions certificates
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuing authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (applicant names, jurisdiction, search dates, declaration status) — never criminal history details if present — providing non-repudiation of the declaration.
