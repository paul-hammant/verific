## What is a Police Clearance Certificate?

You're a British citizen applying for permanent residence in Australia. Immigration requires a police clearance certificate from every country you've lived in for 12+ months in the past 10 years. You lived in the UK, France, and the UAE. You need three separate certificates — from ACRO (UK), the Casier Judiciaire (France), and Dubai Police. Each takes weeks to obtain, arrives in a different format, in a different language, and the Australian immigration officer has no way to verify any of them. Are they real? Are they current? Did you alter the French one to remove a conviction?

Police clearance certificates are one of the most commonly required documents in international immigration — and one of the least verifiable. They're issued by national police forces, arrive as paper or PDF, and the receiving country's immigration authority often has no practical way to confirm authenticity without bilateral law enforcement cooperation, direct issuer contact, or country-specific portals that are not built for foreign routine use.

This is therefore a stronger portability case than most government-ID documents. The certificate is routinely exchanged outside the issuing authority's native system, and the receiving authority is often in another country altogether.

## Data Verified

Applicant name, date of birth, nationality/nationalities, issuing authority, country, reference number, date issued, validity period, result (no convictions / convictions found — but NOT the details of any convictions, which are in the full disclosure version).

**Document Types:**
- **Standard Police Clearance** — States whether the applicant has convictions (yes/no). Does not detail them.
- **Enhanced/Full Disclosure** — Lists actual convictions, cautions, spent/unspent (UK DBS equivalent). More sensitive, higher privacy requirements.
- **Subject Access Certificate** — Issued to the individual themselves (GDPR/data protection right).
- **Apostilled Police Clearance** — Standard certificate with Hague Apostille for international use.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a status code:

- **CLEAR** — No criminal record found for this person
- **CONVICTIONS** — Record found (details not returned in verification response — see full disclosure)
- **EXPIRED** — Certificate validity period has passed; a fresh one is needed
- **PENDING** — Application received, certificate not yet issued
- **404** — No matching record; possible forgery

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the certificate itself (e.g., `acro.police.uk`).

## Second-Party Use

The **Applicant** (second party) benefits from verification.

**Immigration Applications:** Presenting to immigration authorities is the primary use. The applicant obtains certificates from every country they've lived in and presents them as part of a visa or residency application. A verified certificate removes the receiving officer's doubt instantly — no phone calls to foreign police forces, no waiting for bilateral confirmation.

**Foreign Employment:** Presenting to foreign employers who require background checks for international hires. A verified certificate from ACRO or the FBI carries the same weight whether the employer is in London, Dubai, or Singapore.

**Adoption Applications:** International adoption requires clearance from every country the applicant has lived in. Agencies can verify each certificate against the issuing authority's domain.

**Professional Licensing:** Medical, legal, and financial professionals seeking registration in foreign countries. Licensing bodies can verify the certificate without contacting a foreign police force they have no relationship with.

**University Enrollment:** International programs requiring clearance as a condition of admission.

## Third-Party Use

**Immigration Authorities (Primary Verifier)**
Every visa and residency application worldwide requires police clearance from the applicant's countries of residence. This is the highest-volume use. An Australian immigration officer processing 50 applications a day, each with 2-3 certificates from different countries, can verify all of them in seconds instead of filing them as "unable to verify" and hoping for the best.

**Foreign Employers**
Pre-employment background checks for international hires. A company in Singapore hiring a software engineer who lived in Brazil, Germany, and the UK needs three certificates — and currently has no way to verify any of them.

**Adoption Agencies**
International adoption requires clearance from every country the applicant has lived in. Agencies are currently dependent on apostilles and notarized translations, neither of which proves the content is real.

**Professional Licensing Bodies**
Medical, legal, and financial regulators in foreign countries. A doctor trained in India applying for registration in the UK must provide police clearance. The General Medical Council currently has no way to verify an Indian police certificate.

**International Schools**
Teacher hiring across borders. Schools in the UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong hire teachers from dozens of countries — each teacher needs clearance from every country they've worked in.

**Volunteer Organizations**
Safeguarding checks for international volunteers. NGOs sending volunteers to work with children in developing countries need clearance from the volunteer's home country.

**Consulates**
Visa processing. Consular officers process police clearance certificates daily and have no practical verification mechanism for most of them.

## Verification Architecture

**The Police Clearance Fraud Problem**

- **Forged certificates** — The most common fraud. Fabricated certificates from countries the immigration officer can't verify. A convincing letterhead, a plausible reference number, and a stamp — that's all it takes when the officer has never seen a genuine certificate from that country.
- **Altered results** — Changing "convictions found" to "no convictions" on a genuine certificate. A single word change that's invisible without verification.
- **Certificates from countries with no verification infrastructure** — Some developing nations issue certificates that are effectively unverifiable. The receiving authority must trust the paper because there's no alternative.
- **Identity substitution** — Obtaining a certificate in someone else's name. Particularly easy in countries where identity verification at the police office is weak.
- **Expired certificates presented as current** — A conviction occurred after the certificate was issued, but the applicant presents the old certificate showing a clean record.
- **The multilingual problem** — Certificates arrive in French, Arabic, Portuguese, Mandarin. The immigration officer often can't even read them, let alone verify them. Live Verify bypasses the language barrier entirely — the hash is language-agnostic. The French certificate and the English certificate produce different hashes, but both resolve to the same issuing authority's domain. The verification response is what matters, not whether the officer can read the document.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

National police forces and criminal records authorities are the sole issuers. Each country's authority is the root for its own criminal records:
- **ACRO** (UK) — acro.police.uk
- **FBI** (US) — fbi.gov
- **Casier Judiciaire** (France) — casier-judiciaire.justice.gouv.fr
- **BKA** (Germany) — bka.de
- **Australian Federal Police** (Australia) — afp.gov.au
- **RCMP** (Canada) — rcmp-grc.gc.ca
- **Dubai Police** (UAE) — dubaipolice.gov.ae

## Privacy Salt

Critical. Criminal record data is among the most sensitive personal data. In many jurisdictions (UK Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, EU GDPR), spent convictions have legal protections against disclosure. The hash MUST be salted to prevent enumeration of who has been checked and what the results were. Without salt, an attacker who knows a person's name and date of birth could guess-and-check to determine whether they have a criminal record — a direct violation of rehabilitation-of-offenders protections in most jurisdictions.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Each country's police/criminal records authority is sovereign — the chain terminates at the national government. There is no supranational police clearance authority; Interpol coordinates but does not issue certificates.

UK (ACRO → Home Office → gov.uk):

```
✓ acro.police.uk/pcc/v — Issues UK police clearance certificates
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

US (FBI → usa.gov):

```
✓ fbi.gov/background-checks/v — Issues US criminal background checks
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

France (Casier Judiciaire → gouv.fr):

```
✓ casier-judiciaire.justice.gouv.fr/v — Délivre les extraits de casier judiciaire (issues criminal record extracts)
  ✓ gouv.fr — Portail du gouvernement français (French government root namespace)
```

Germany (BKA → bund.de):

```
✓ bka.de/fuehrungszeugnis/v — Stellt polizeiliche Führungszeugnisse aus (issues police clearance certificates)
  ✓ bund.de — Bundesregierung (German federal government root namespace)
```

Australia (AFP → gov.au):

```
✓ afp.gov.au/police-checks/v — Issues Australian police clearance certificates
  ✓ gov.au — Australian government root namespace
```

## Competition vs. Existing Verification Methods

| Feature | Live Verify | Bilateral Law Enforcement Requests | Interpol Channels | Apostille | Trusting the Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | **5 seconds.** Scan and verify. | **Months.** Formal request through diplomatic channels. | **Days to weeks.** Law enforcement only. | **Days.** Proves signature, not content. | **Instant.** But no verification. |
| **Access** | **Anyone.** Immigration officer, employer, adoption agency. | **Government only.** Bilateral agreement required. | **Law enforcement only.** Not accessible to immigration caseworkers. | **Anyone.** But only proves the signature is real. | **Anyone.** No verification at all. |
| **Content Verification** | **Yes.** Hash confirms the document content hasn't been altered. | **Yes.** Full record exchange (when it happens). | **Yes.** But limited to Interpol member cooperation. | **No.** Proves the signing official is real, not that the content is accurate. | **No.** Visual inspection only. |
| **Multilingual** | **Language-agnostic.** Hash works regardless of document language. | **Requires translation.** | **English/French/Spanish/Arabic.** | **Requires translation.** | **Officer may not read the language.** |
| **Routine Use** | **Yes.** Designed for high-volume daily processing. | **No.** Reserved for serious cases. Not used for routine immigration. | **No.** Not available for visa processing. | **Yes.** But proves form, not substance. | **Yes.** The current default for most countries. |
| **Coverage** | **Any participating authority.** Scales with adoption. | **Bilateral only.** Depends on which countries have agreements. | **194 member countries.** But access is restricted. | **Hague Convention members.** ~120 countries. | **Universal.** Every country issues paper. |

**Why this remains strong:** The current default for most immigration authorities worldwide is still "trust the paper." Bilateral law enforcement channels are too slow for routine processing, Interpol channels are restricted, and apostilles prove signature rather than content. That makes police clearance certificates one of the clearer cases where a portable verification bridge is genuinely doing work outside the issuer's native system.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the police authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (certificate number, applicant name, date of issue, clearance status, issuing authority) — never conviction details or applicant addresses — providing non-repudiation of police clearance certificate issuance.

## Further Derivations

1. **Interpol notices and diffusions** — International law enforcement alerts (Red Notices, Blue Notices) — verification that a notice is real or that a claimed "Interpol clearance" is genuine. Currently, anyone can fabricate a letter claiming Interpol has cleared them. A verify line bound to `interpol.int` would settle it instantly.
2. **Safeguarding/vulnerable person checks** — DBS in the UK, Working with Children Check in Australia — enhanced background checks for people working with children or vulnerable adults. Higher sensitivity, stricter privacy requirements, but the same verification pattern: scan, hash, check against the issuing authority's domain.
