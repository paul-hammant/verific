## What is an Apprenticeship Certificate?

In trades like plumbing, electrical, or software engineering, you don't just go to school; you complete thousands of hours of on-the-job training.

The **Certificate of Completion** is the proof that you finished those hours. For a plumber, it's the "Journeyman" card that lets them work without a supervisor. For a software intern, it's the proof that they actually did real work at a major company.

Because these lead directly to high-paying jobs, "internship fraud" (faking a certificate from Google or a local union) is a major problem for recruiters.

## Data Verified

Intern/Apprentice name, sponsor organization, specific program name (e.g., "Journeyman Electrician"), start/end dates, total hours completed, supervisor name, issuing date.

**Document Types:**
- **Internship Completion Certificate:** For students/graduates.
- **Journeyman Card:** For skilled trades (Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC).
- **Certificate of Apprenticeship:** Formal government-recognized program.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Company or Union) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Completed** — Program successfully finished.
- **In-Progress** — Currently enrolled (shows hours to date).
- **Withdrawn** — Did not finish the program.
- **Revoked** — Certificate pulled due to disciplinary issues.

## Second-Party Use

The **Intern** or **Apprentice** benefits from verification.

**Job Hunting:** Proving to a future employer that they didn't just "hang out" at a famous company for a summer, but actually completed a structured 480-hour program with a verified CTO.

**College Credit:** Submitting verified proof of internship hours to their university to receive academic credit.

**Trade Licensing:** Using verified hours to qualify for a state professional license (e.g., a Master Plumber license requires verified apprenticeship hours).

## Third-Party Use

**Hiring Managers / Recruiters**
**Resume De-risking:** Internship fraud is common. Scanning the certificate hash instantly confirms the candidate actually worked those dates and wasn't just a friend of someone at the company.

**State Licensing Boards**
**Verification of Experience:** Boards can instantly verify that the hours claimed on a license application match the sponsor's official records, preventing "ghost hours."

**University Registrars**
**Credit Validation:** Ensuring that the "summer internship" submitted for credit was a legitimate, completed program.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Internship" Fraud Problem**

- **Impostor Companies:** Websites that pretend to be real companies and provide fake "completion letters" for a fee.
- **Inflated Scope:** Changing a "Marketing Intern" certificate to read "Senior Product Intern" to get a better job.
- **Date Stretching:** Altering a 4-week internship to appear as a 12-week program.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Corporations:** (Google, Goldman Sachs, local businesses).
**Trade Unions:** (IBEW, UA, Teamsters).
**Government Depts:** (Department of Labor Apprenticeship office).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Apprenticeships are regulated in the UK through the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual).

```
✓ apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/verify — Issues apprenticeship completion certificates
  ✓ ofqual.gov.uk — Regulates qualifications and exams in England
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the educational institution or employer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (apprentice name, program, completion date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the document.

## Scope and Limitations

**Where verification adds the most value:**

- **Major employers with brand reputation** (Google, Goldman Sachs, Fortune 500) — These companies have reputational stakes; their attestation carries weight.
- **Trade unions with licensing authority** (IBEW, UA, Teamsters) — Journeyman cards are prerequisites for state licenses; verification prevents "ghost hours."
- **Government-registered apprenticeship programs** — Department of Labor oversight provides institutional backing.

**Where verification adds less value:**

- **Unknown SMEs** — If a verifier has never heard of "Techno-Dynamic Systems, LLC," the company's domain attestation doesn't tell them whether the program was legitimate or just an owner's nephew fetching coffee.
- **Informal internships** — "Helping out at a friend's startup" isn't made more credible by a hash.

**The trust hierarchy:** Verification proves "this domain attests to this claim." For major employers, that attestation is valuable because their reputation is on the line. For unknown companies, the verifier still needs to assess whether the *issuer* is credible — and verification doesn't help with that step.

## Competition vs. LinkedIn / Background Checks

| Feature | Live Verify | LinkedIn | Background Check (Checkr/Hireright) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to company domain. | **Social.** Self-reported; zero verification for internships. | **High.** But slow and expensive. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan and see "Verified by techno-dynamic.com." | **N/A.** Just looking at a profile. | **Slow.** Takes 3-7 days to call the company. |
| **Portability** | **High.** Certificate works in any country/language. | **High.** Global platform. | **Low.** Tied to a specific employer request. |

**Why OCR fits major employers:** Recruitment is about speed and trust. A recruiter can verify a candidate's "Fortune 500" internship *during* the initial phone screen by scanning their PDF/paper certificate, bypassing the 5-day delay and $50 cost of a formal background check. For unknown companies, the recruiter still needs to assess the issuer's credibility separately.
