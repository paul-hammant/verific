## What are Travel and Hospitality Documents?

The travel industry is a "Chain of Trust" involving airlines, hotels, tour operators, and online travel agencies (OTAs). A **Travel Itinerary** or **Booking Confirmation** is the bundle of documents that prove a traveler has paid for and is authorized to receive services.

This sector faces massive high-volume fraud. From **Expense Reimbursement Fraud** (employees editing hotel bills to add fake meals) to **Visa Fraud** (applicants creating fake "Ghost Itineraries" to trick embassies), the lack of a verifiable link between the physical paper and the supplier's database costs billions annually. Verified hashes bind the **Itinerary Details, Pricing, and Dates** to the supplier's or the platform's domain (e.g., `concur.com`, `expedia.com`, or `hilton.com`).

## Data Verified

Booking reference number (PNR), traveler name, company name, trip dates, flight numbers/classes, hotel names/room types, itemized costs, total trip price, booking source (e.g., Concur vs. Personal), cancellation policy tier, date of issuance.

**Document Types:**
- **Consolidated Itinerary:** The summary of multiple bookings.
- **Hotel Guest Folio:** The final itemized receipt after stay.
- **E-Ticket Receipt:** Proving payment for air travel.
- **Expense Summary:** (Linked hash) for internal corporate approval.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`concur.com`, `expedia.com`, `hilton.com`, `united.com`) and the status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Confirmed / Paid** — Trip is valid and services are authorized.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** The booking was voided; this document is no longer a valid expense.
- **Modificaton Active** — A newer version of the trip exists.
- **No-Show Reported** — **ALERT:** The traveler did not use the services (indicates expense fraud).

## Second-Party Use

The **Business Traveler** benefits from verification.

**Expense Approval Speed:** Instead of waiting 2 weeks for a human auditor to review a PDF, the traveler provides the verified hash. The finance system can instantly see **"VERIFIED BY CONCUR"** and match it against the corporate credit card feed, getting the employee reimbursed in 24 hours.

**Visa Approval:** A traveler applying for a business visa can show the verified hash of their "Company Itinerary." Consular officers can see **"CONFIRMED - GLOBAL LOGISTICS CORP"** on the official Concur domain, removing the common "fake booking" suspicion that leads to visa delays.

## Third-Party Use

**Corporate Finance / Auditors**
**Zero-Trust Auditing:** Thousands of "Edited" hotel folios are submitted every month. Live Verify connects the auditor directly to the source (e.g., Hilton's record), stopping "Meal Inflation" or "Ghost Stay" fraud at the source.

**Travel Insurers**
**Claims Adjudication:** If a trip is cancelled, the insurer scans the verified itinerary. "Verified by United" ensures that the "Non-Refundable Loss" claimed by the traveler is an accurate fact, preventing over-payment of claims.

**Government Regulators**
**Tax Compliance Audit:** Verifying that "Travel Deductions" reported by a company match the verified hashes from legitimate travel providers, reducing the need for manual receipt-scanning audits.

## Verification Architecture

**The "PDF Pivot" Fraud Problem**

- **Class Padding:** Editing an "Economy" ticket into a "Business" ticket on a PDF to claim a higher reimbursement.
- **Incidentals Hiding:** Removing a "Mini-Bar" or "Spa" charge from a hotel folio so the entire bill appears to be a "Valid Business Room Rate."
- **Ghost Bookings:** Creating a fake confirmation for a trip that was never taken to steal corporate funds.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Distribution Systems (GDS) like Amadeus/Sabre.**
**Corporate Travel Portals (Concur, Egencia).**
**Direct Suppliers (Airlines, Hotel Groups).**

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Itineraries reveal locations and habits. The hash must be salted to prevent "Stalking" or "Executive Tracking" by unauthorized parties.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Issues hotel bookings and confirmations

```
✓ booking.example-hotel.co.uk/verify — Issues hotel bookings and confirmations
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Travel documentation is the "High-Volume Friction" of global business. By turning itineraries into verifiable digital bridges, we eliminate the friction of manual auditing and protect the multibillion-dollar travel budget from the high cost of "Small-Ticket" fraud.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive travel suppliers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (booking reference number, traveler name, company name, trip dates, flight numbers/classes, hotel names/room types, itemized costs, total trip price, booking source, cancellation policy tier, date of issuance) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the travel and hospitality booking.
