## What is a Good-Standing Letter?

Just because someone has a law degree doesn't mean they are allowed to practice law today. They might have been suspended for stealing client money or disbarred for ethics violations.

A **Certificate of Good Standing** is the "Live License" for a lawyer. It is issued by the Supreme Court of their state and proves they are active and compliant.

**Why would you bother verifying?** Because the consequences of engaging a suspended or disbarred lawyer are severe and often irreversible. Contracts drafted by an unauthorized practitioner may be voidable. Court filings made by someone not in good standing can be struck, causing missed deadlines that cannot be recovered. A client who discovers their lawyer was suspended only after losing a case or a property transaction has limited recourse — malpractice insurance typically does not cover unauthorized practice, and the disciplinary system is designed to protect future clients, not to compensate past ones. The harm compounds: the client loses the case, loses the fees paid, and may face costs awarded to the other side — all because the person standing in court was not actually permitted to be there.

The strongest architecture is still the court or bar's own public status page or registry where one exists. Live Verify is more credible as a bridge when the good-standing letter itself is the portable artifact being filed, emailed, or shown in court.

## Data Verified

Attorney name, bar registration number, admission date, current status (Good Standing, Suspended, Disbarred), disciplinary history summary, issuing court/department, date of letter.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Good Standing:** For out-of-state admission (Pro Hac Vice).
- **Attorney Registration Card:** Pocket ID.
- **Disciplinary History Extract:** For judicial appointments.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **OK** — Attorney is in good standing
- **SUSPENDED** — Temporarily barred (non-payment, ethics investigation)
- **DISBARRED** — Permanently removed from practice
- **404** — Not found (deceased, never admitted, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the document itself (e.g., `nycourts.gov`).

**More Information:**

The response includes a link to the bar association's public profile:

```
HTTP 200 OK

Status: OK
More: https://nycourts.gov/attorneys/profile/saul-goodman
```

This page shows admission date, disciplinary history, CLE compliance, and contact details for the bar association if you have concerns. The existing complaint infrastructure handles reporting—no need to duplicate it here.

## Second-Party Use

The **Attorney** benefits from verification.

**Pro Hac Vice Admission:** When an attorney needs to practice in a foreign state for one specific case, the foreign court requires a "Good Standing" letter from their home state. A verified letter prevents the 2-week delay of mailing physical paper between court clerks.

**Job Applications:** Proving to a law firm or corporate legal department that their license is active and they have no hidden disciplinary history.

## Third-Party Use

**Courts and Judges**
**Authority to Practice:** A judge can scan the attorney's ID or standing letter in the courtroom to ensure the person standing before them is actually a member of the bar and hasn't been quietly suspended.

**Banks and Lenders**
**Escrow Account Verification:** Ensuring that an attorney opening an IOLA/IOLTA (trust) account is in good standing and authorized to hold client funds.

**Clients**
**Consumer Protection:** A client can verify their lawyer's status before signing a retainer or handing over a large deposit.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Lawyer" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Theft:** A non-lawyer using the name and bar number of a real, perhaps retired, attorney to open a fake firm and steal client deposits.
- **Suspension Concealment:** An attorney who was suspended last month presenting a "Good Standing" letter they printed three months ago.
- **Fabricated Credentials:** Using a high-quality template to create a bar admission certificate for a non-existent lawyer.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Supreme Courts:** (The ultimate authority in most US states).
**State Bar Associations:** (Acting as the administrative arm).
**National Registries:** (e.g., ABA National Lawyer Regulatory Data Bank).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

US attorneys are admitted by their state's court system, not a federal body. The chain terminates at the state government — Tenth Amendment sovereignty.

```
✓ nycourts.gov/attorneys/v — Admits and regulates New York attorneys
  ✓ ny.gov — New York state government
```

UK solicitors are regulated by the SRA under the Legal Services Act:

```
✓ sra.org.uk/solicitors/verify — Regulates solicitors in England and Wales
  ✓ legalservicesboard.org.uk — Oversees approved legal regulators
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the bar association's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the admission certificate.
## Competition vs. Public Search (Attorney Search)

| Feature | Live Verify | Public Attorney Search | Paper Certificate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Date.** Proves standing *as of the letter date*. | **Live.** Shows standing *today*. | **Static.** Easily faked. |
| **Efficiency** | **Fast bridge from the letter.** | **Primary.** Live status path. | **Manual.** Compare seals. |
| **Trust** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `nycourts.gov`. | **High.** But prone to "Similar Name" errors. | **Medium.** |

**Narrower conclusion:** Public attorney search should remain primary where it is practical. Live Verify is complementary when the good-standing letter is already the artifact in motion and the verifier wants to bind that specific letter to the correct lawyer without name-search ambiguity.
