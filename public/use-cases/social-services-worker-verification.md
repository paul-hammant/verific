## What is Social Services Verification?

In child welfare and adult protective services, the "Home Visit" is a critical and sensitive moment. A worker from **Child Protective Services (CPS)** or a **Welfare Officer** may knock on a door at any time to inspect a child's environment or check on a vulnerable senior.

This high-stakes authority is a primary weapon for criminals. Scammers pose as "Social Workers" to gain entry for home invasion, robbery, or in extreme cases, **Child Abduction.** Families are often too scared or intimidated to challenge the person's authority.

Live Verify allows a family to scan the worker's ID card to verify: **"Is this a legitimate government employee, and are they currently authorized to conduct field investigations?"**

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the household's perspective. The home visit is initiated by the social services agency.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The caseworker can escalate to court orders, recommend child removal, or trigger investigations — consequences that families cannot safely ignore, even when suspicious.

**Verification asymmetry:** The family is being asked to cooperate and grant entry immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the person at the door is a current, authorized government caseworker.

**Substitution compounds the risk.** A social services agency may send a different caseworker than the one the family expects — a locum, a trainee, or an unqualified stand-in. The credential may be genuine (issued by the agency) but worn by someone who lacks the training, clearance, or case knowledge to conduct the visit safely. In cases involving vulnerable adults or children on safeguarding plans, an unqualified worker entering a home creates immediate risk: missed warning signs, improper assessments, or escalation of a volatile situation.

**Verification protects the worker too.** Social workers conducting home visits face false allegations from families — fabricated claims of misconduct, intimidation, or unauthorized removal of children. These complaints can end careers. A verified interaction log with a timestamp proves the worker was a current, authorized government employee at the time and place of the visit, providing contemporaneous evidence against false accusations.

**The consequences are specific and severe.** A family that admits a fake social worker may suffer home invasion, theft of identity documents, or — in documented cases — child abduction by someone claiming state authority. A genuine caseworker visiting the wrong household without proper identification may trigger panic, confrontation, or flight by a family already under stress.

## Data Verified

Worker name, employee ID number, agency name, photograph (via hash), role/title, supervisor name, office location, expiration date, background check status.

**Document Types:**
- **Agency ID Badge:** The primary field identification.
- **Notice of Welfare Check:** Paper left if the resident isn't home.
- **Warrant of Entry:** (In some jurisdictions) Formal court-linked authority.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`dcfs.illinois.gov`, `dcyf.wa.gov`) and the worker's status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active Duty** — Worker is currently employed and authorized for field work.
- **Verified Investigation** — (Optional) A case number exists for this household today.
- **Inactive** — Person is no longer an agency employee.
- **Fraud Alert** — **ALERT:** This ID has been flagged for impersonation attempts.

## Second-Party Use

The **Family / Citizen** benefits from verification.

**Anti-Abduction Safety:** A person claiming to be "from the state" arrives to take a child into protective custody. The terrified parent scans the worker's ID. If it returns **"ACTIVE DUTY - DCFS,"** they know they must comply with the legal process. If it returns **"UNKNOWN,"** they immediately lock the door and call 911 to prevent a kidnapping.

**Home Security:** A senior citizen living alone is visited by an "Adult Protective Services" worker. They verify the credentials through the screen door, ensuring the visitor is a vetted professional and not a "Sweetheart Swindler" or burglar.

## Third-Party Use

**Police and First Responders**
**Scene Coordination:** Patrol officers called to a "Domestic Incident" can quickly verify the identity of social workers already on the scene, ensuring that the "Civilian" presence is authorized and not an interloper.

**Hospital Security**
**Patient Access:** Verifying the credentials of caseworkers visiting children or seniors in the ER or ICU to ensure they have the legal right to access medical info.

## Verification Architecture

**The "State Authority" Fraud Problem**

- **Intimidation Scams:** Criminals using fake "DCFS" badges to threaten parents into paying "fines" or giving up children.
- **Information Gathering:** Posing as a social worker to "interview" neighbors and gather PII for identity theft.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A worker who was fired for abuse keeping their ID to continue harassing former clients.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Departments of Human Services.**
**County Child Welfare Agencies.**
**Contracted Foster Care Agencies.**

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. Caseworker names and routes are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Caseload Scraping" or tracking the movements of individual employees.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Local authorities employ social services workers and issue employment verification under the Children Act 1989 and Care Act 2014.

```
✓ socialworker.localauthority.gov.uk/verify — Local authority social services worker credentials
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Social services verification is about "Safety for the Vulnerable." By allowing families to instantly cross-reference a physical badge with a digital government record, we eliminate the primary weapon of predators: the fear of state authority.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the social services agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (worker name, employee ID, role, office location) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of worker credential issuance.
