## What is an Art Conservation Report?

When a famous painting (like a Rembrandt) is cleaned or repaired, it must be done by a high-level scientist called a **Conservator**.

The **Conservation Report** is the detailed log of every chemical, solvent, and brushstroke used. It is the "Medical History" of the artwork.

Fraudsters often hide "Over-Restoration"—where so much new paint has been added that the original artist's work is lost. They might edit a report to hide a massive tear that was repaired. Verified reports ensure the museum or buyer knows exactly what has been done to the masterpiece.

## Data Verified

Object title/artist, owner name, detailed treatment description, chemical materials used (solvents/resins), completion date, lead conservator credentials, laboratory/institution ID, condition status post-treatment.

**Document Types:**
- **Treatment Summary:** High-level proof of restoration.
- **Condition Report:** Pre-loan assessment for museum travel.
- **Scientific Analysis:** (e.g., X-ray, Infrared Reflectography findings).
- **Maintenance Log:** Annual dusting/environmental checks.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`getty.edu`, `rijksmuseum.nl`) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Report matches the institution's official archival record.
- **Superseded** — A more recent treatment has been performed (essential for safety).
- **In-Progress** — Treatment not yet finalized.
- **Alert** — Potential damage reported post-treatment.

## Second-Party Use

The **Museum Curator** or **Art Collector** benefits from verification.

**Loan Logistics:** Proving to a borrowing museum that a masterpiece is "Verified Fit for Travel" based on a recent conservation report. This speeds up the insurance underwriting for the loan.

**Resale Transparency:** A private collector can prove that a painting hasn't been "Over-Restored" (which ruins value), by showing a verified report from a reputable independent conservator.

## Third-Party Use

**Fine Art Insurers**
**Liability Underwriting:** Insurers verify the "Restoration History" before covering high-value works. A painting with "Hidden Structural Cracks" is a massive risk. Live Verify ensures the report provided by the owner matches the conservator's true findings.

**Art Historians / Scholars**
**Archival Research:** Instantly verifying that a digitized conservation report from 1950 is an authentic record of what was done to the painting, aiding in the study of artist techniques.

**Auction Houses**
**Vetting:** Verifying that the "Condition Report" in the sale catalog matches the expert findings, reducing the house's liability for undisclosed repairs.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Over-Restoration" Fraud Problem**

- **Damage Concealment:** Editing a report to remove mention of a "Repaired Tear" or "Extensive Over-painting" to deceive a buyer.
- **Date Alteration:** Changing a 10-year-old condition report to look like it was done last month to hide recent environmental damage (mold/bloom).
- **Expert Impersonation:** Creating a fake report on the letterhead of a famous museum conservation lab.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Museum Conservation Labs:** (The Getty, The Met, The British Museum).
**Private Conservation Firms:** (AIC / ICON members).
**Art Institutes:** (Handling specialized material science).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Conservators document restoration work and assess heritage preservation needs.

```
✓ conservation.example-conservator.co.uk/verify — Documents conservation and restoration work
  ✓ icon.org.uk — Sets conservation and heritage standards
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the report it issued.


## Competition vs. Museum Management Systems (TMS)

| Feature | Live Verify | TMS (The Museum System) | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Trust the Institution. | **System-Bound.** Trust the DB admin. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Share with any insurer/buyer. | **Zero.** External parties never get TMS logins. | **Universal.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds every detail. | **High.** Internal only. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Permanence** | **Archival.** Text is permanent. | **Ephemeral.** Databases get migrated/lost. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "External Trust" problem. A museum's internal database (TMS) is great for them, but useless for the **Rest of the World**. When a painting travels or is sold, the trust must move with it. Live Verify turns the **Static PDF Report** into a cryptographically trusted artifact that anyone can verify without a TMS password.
