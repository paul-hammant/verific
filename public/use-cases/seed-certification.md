## What is Seed Certification?

In global agriculture, a **Seed Certification Tag** (often a blue, purple, or white tag sewn into a bag) is the proof that the seed inside is exactly what the label says it is. It guarantees the "Genetic Purity" of the variety and that the seeds have passed tests for **Germination Rate** and absence of "Noxious Weeds."

These tags are the "Intellectual Property" of the seed world. Fraud is common in high-value crops (e.g., GMO Soybeans or Hybrid Corn). Shady dealers often "edit" a tag to turn generic, low-quality grain into a "Certified High-Yield" variety to sell it at a 500% markup. Similarly, they might hide a poor germination test result. Verified hashes bind the **Lot Number, Variety Name, and Purity Metrics** to the state's or the breeder's domain (e.g., `aosca.org` or `monsanto.com`).

## Data Verified

Lot number, tag ID, crop name, variety name (e.g., "Golden-Harvest 42"), class of seed (Foundation/Registered/Certified), germination percentage, pure seed percentage, inert matter percentage, weed seed count, date of test, certifier name/state, grower name.

**Document Types:**
- **Seed Certification Tag:** The high-visibility tag on the bag.
- **Analysis Report:** The detailed lab findings.
- **Bulk Sales Certificate:** For tractor-trailer loads.
- **PVP (Plant Variety Protection) License:** Proof of legal right to sell.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`aosca.org`, `state-crop-improvement.org`, `corteva.com`) and the seed standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified / Valid** — Seed matches the original lab and field audit.
- **Test Expired** — **ALERT:** Germination data is more than 9 months old; re-test required.
- **Banned Lot** — **CRITICAL:** High levels of restricted weeds found; do not plant.
- **IP Dispute** — **ALERT:** Sale of this variety is blocked due to a licensing violation.

## Second-Party Use

The **Farmer** (second party) receives the seed certification from the certifying agency (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The farmer has their own verified copy of the seed quality metrics. Most of the time, the document sits in their farm records—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The farmer can confirm at any time that the certification matches what the agency's system recorded and hasn't been altered, ensuring they're planting the high-yield, disease-resistant variety they paid for.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about crop failure, IP compliance audits, or loan defaults—the farmer has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the certifying agency.

## Third-Party Use

The farmer (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Agricultural Lenders (Loan Collateral)**
Banks providing "Input Loans" receive verified seed hashes from farmers. This ensures the loan is being used for high-quality, insured-eligible inputs, reducing the risk of a crop failure and protecting the lender's collateral.

**Seed Companies / IP Auditors (PVP Compliance)**
During a "Plant Variety Protection" (PVP) audit, the farmer provides verified hashes to prove they legally purchased the seeds and aren't "brown-bagging" (illegally replanting) protected varieties.

**Export Authorities (Phytosanitary Vetting)**
Customs officials receive verified seed certifications to confirm that seeds being exported match the "clean" lab results required by the importing nation, stopping the spread of invasive weed species.

**Seed Dealers / Wholesalers (Inventory Verification)**
A dealer receiving 500 bags of seed scans the verified hashes to ensure the lot numbers match the shipping manifest and that no "uncertified" bags have been mixed into the high-value shipment.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Brown Bag" Fraud Problem**

- **Variety Masking:** Selling cheap "Generic" wheat in a bag with a fake "Premium Variety" tag.
- **Germination Padding:** Editing a "75%" (Poor) germination result into a "95%" (Excellent) one on a PDF analysis report.
- **Tag Re-Use:** Harvesting the blue tags from a real shipment and sewing them onto bags of low-quality grain.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- National Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA)
- State Crop Improvement Associations
- Global Seed Companies (for internal IP tracking)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. While variety names are public, specific grower field locations and total purchase volumes are sensitive business secrets. The combination of lot numbers, tag IDs, and precise quality metrics (99.85% purity, 94.00% germination) provides some entropy, but the risk that competitors could use enumeration for "market-share mapping"—tracking which farmers are buying which varieties and in what volumes—means salt is essential. Salt protects both farmer privacy and seed company competitive intelligence.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Seed certifying agencies are regulated by animal and plant health authorities to verify seed genetic purity, germination rates, and freedom from noxious weeds protecting crop integrity.

```
✓ seed.apha.gov.uk/verify — Issues verified seed certifications
  ✓ apha.gov.uk — Administers UK animal and plant health controls
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the certifying agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (lot number, tag ID, variety name, germination rate, purity percentage, test date) — never plaintext like grower names or field locations — providing non-repudiation of the seed certification.

### When a Farmer Plants the Wrong Seed

The consequence is not immediate — it unfolds over an entire growing season. A farmer buys 500 bags of "certified drought-resistant hybrid corn" at a significant premium. The tags look genuine. The seed goes into the ground. Four months later, during a dry spell, the crop fails — because the seed was actually a cheaper, non-drought-resistant variety repackaged with forged certification tags. The farmer has lost the entire season's income, the planting window has closed, and crop insurance may not cover a loss caused by fraudulent seed. A verifiable certification tag, bound to the certifying agency's domain, would have let the farmer or the co-op confirm the variety and lot number before planting. The five-second scan at the warehouse prevents a six-month catastrophe in the field.

## Rationale

Seed is the "Software of the Earth." By turning tags into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the billions of dollars in R&D that go into crop breeding and ensure that farmers are planting the high-performance genetics they were promised.
