## What are Mandatory Disclosures?

When bad things happen—data breaches, product defects, financial problems, public health risks—organizations often have **legal obligations to disclose**. But disclosure hurts: stock prices drop, lawsuits follow, reputations suffer. The incentive to delay, minimize, or obscure is enormous.

Verified disclosure records create **immutable timestamps** proving exactly when disclosures were made, to whom, and what was said. Organizations can't later claim they disclosed earlier than they did—or that they disclosed at all.

## The Delay Problem

**Equifax (2017):** Discovered breach July 29, disclosed September 7—**40 days** while executives sold stock.

**Yahoo (2016):** 500 million accounts breached in 2014, disclosed in **2016**—two years later, during acquisition talks.

**Volkswagen (2015):** Knew about emissions cheating for years before disclosure forced by regulators.

**Boeing 737 MAX:** Internal concerns about MCAS system not disclosed to regulators or airlines.

**Pattern:** Discovery → Internal debate → Legal review → Minimize scope → Delay → Forced disclosure → "We acted promptly" claims.

**With verified disclosures:** The timestamp is cryptographic. You can't rewrite history.

## Data Verified

Disclosing organization, disclosure type, regulatory authority, discovery date, notification date, deadline compliance, scope/impact, affected parties, remediation status.

## Status Indications

- **Timely** — Disclosed within required timeframe
- **Late** — Disclosed after deadline (penalties may apply)
- **Pending** — Disclosure filed, under regulatory review
- **Updated** — Amended with new information
- **Closed** — Regulatory review complete

## Why Verification Matters

### The "We Acted Promptly" Defense

After every delayed disclosure, companies claim:
- "We notified as soon as we understood the scope"
- "We needed time to investigate before alarming people"
- "Our disclosure was within the required timeframe"

**With verified disclosures:**
- Discovery timestamp is recorded
- Notification timestamp is recorded
- The gap is calculable
- "Prompt" becomes provable (or disprovable)

### The Litigation Timeline

In class action lawsuits after breaches/recalls:
1. **Plaintiffs claim:** Company knew for months before disclosing
2. **Company claims:** We disclosed promptly once we confirmed the issue
3. **Discovery:** Years of document production to establish timeline

**With verified disclosures:**
- Internal discovery notification: timestamped
- Regulatory notification: timestamped
- Public notification: timestamped
- Timeline is cryptographically established

### The Regulatory Audit

Regulators investigating delays:
- GDPR: Did you notify within 72 hours?
- SEC: Did you file 8-K within 4 business days?
- FDA: Did you report within 24 hours?

**Verified records:** Compliance or non-compliance is immediately provable.

## International Equivalents

| Category | US | UK | EU | Australia |
|----------|----|----|----|----|
| **Data Breach** | State laws, SEC | ICO (GDPR) | GDPR (72h) | OAIC (30 days) |
| **Financial** | SEC 8-K | FCA/LSE RNS | MAR | ASX continuous |
| **Product Safety** | CPSC, FDA, NHTSA | OPSS | RAPEX | ACCC |
| **Public Health** | CDC | UKHSA | ECDC | Health Dept |
| **Consumer** | FTC | CMA | National auth | ACCC |
| **Telecom** | FCC | Ofcom | BEREC | ACMA |

## Second-Party Use

The **Disclosing Organization** benefits from verification.

**Compliance Proof:** "We met the 72-hour GDPR deadline—here's the cryptographic proof."

**Litigation Defense:** Verified timeline defeats claims of extended delay.

**Insurance Claims:** D&O insurance may require proof of timely disclosure for coverage.

**Regulatory Good Faith:** Pattern of verified timely disclosures builds credibility with regulators.

## Third-Party Use

**Regulators**
**Enforcement:** Verify whether disclosure deadlines were met.

**Plaintiffs' Attorneys**
**Class Actions:** Verified timelines establish when company knew vs. when they told.

**Investors**
**Due Diligence:** Pattern of late disclosures indicates governance problems.

**Journalists**
**Investigation:** Compare discovery dates to disclosure dates across incidents.

**Insurance Underwriters**
**D&O Pricing:** Disclosure history informs governance risk assessment.

**Affected Parties**
**Rights Enforcement:** Know exactly when you should have been told.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Regulated companies disclose material events (breaches, recalls, financial events) under FCA oversight to provide verified immutable records of compliance.

```
✓ disclosures.example-corp.co.uk/verify — Issues verified mandatory disclosure records
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK investment firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Novel Applications

**Disclosure Heat Maps**
Aggregate verified disclosure timing across industries. Which sectors are habitually late?

**Regulatory Benchmarking**
Compare enforcement across jurisdictions. Which regulators tolerate delays?

**Pre-Disclosure Commitment**
Organizations could commit to disclosure timelines in advance—verified records show whether they honor commitments.

**Insurance Automation**
D&O insurers could query disclosure history automatically during underwriting.

**Investor Alerts**
Subscribe to verified disclosure feeds for portfolio companies. Know about material events immediately, with timestamp proof.


## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the disclosing organization's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (disclosure type, discovery date, notification date, regulatory authority, compliance status) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the disclosure and timeline.
