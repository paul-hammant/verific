## What is Proof of Address?

You're opening a bank account. The advisor says: "I need proof of address — a recent utility bill or bank statement." You pull up a PDF of your electricity bill on your phone. The advisor glances at it. That's the entire "verification" — a human eyeballing a PDF that takes three minutes to forge.

Utility bills, broadband bills, and mobile phone statements are the world's most commonly accepted proof of address documents. They are also among the easiest to fake. The address, the name, and the account number are plain text in a standard layout. Anyone with a PDF editor and a template can produce a convincing forgery.

Live Verify flips the model. Instead of the bank trusting a document the *customer* provides, the telco or energy provider publishes a salted hash confirming: **"We write to this person at this address concerning an active account."** The bank checks the hash against the provider's domain. The document becomes a carrier for the claim — the authority rests with the issuer's endpoint, not the PDF.

This remains a strong case because the utility or telco is itself the source of truth for the narrow claim being checked. There usually is no better universal native system than the provider saying "yes, this account is active at this address."

## Data Verified

Account holder full name, service address (full postal address), account active-since date, issuer identity (utility/telco name).

**Document Types:**
- **Utility Statement Address Block:** Structured block from gas, electricity, or water provider confirming name and address.
- **Telco Statement Address Block:** Same from broadband, mobile, or landline provider.
- **Council Tax Bill Address Block:** Local authority confirming name and address for tax purposes.

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. Name + address combinations are low entropy and easily guessable. Without a salt, an attacker could hash common names against known addresses to discover who lives where. The issuer includes a per-account salt in the hash computation. The salt is printed on the statement (or embedded in the verification line) so the verifier can reconstruct the hash, but an attacker without the document cannot enumerate.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`britishgas.co.uk`, `bt.com`, `thameswater.co.uk`) and account status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Verified** — Active account at this address, name matches issuer records.
- **Closed** — Account has been closed (customer moved or cancelled service).
- **Superseded** — A newer address confirmation exists (customer changed address but kept account).
- **Disputed** — Account holder has flagged the record as incorrect.

## Second-Party Use

The **Account Holder** benefits from verification.

**Faster Onboarding:** Opening a bank account, applying for a mortgage, registering with a GP — anywhere proof of address is required. Instead of uploading a PDF and waiting for manual review, the verifier checks the hash in seconds.

**Multiple Verifiers, One Document:** The same statement can be verified by the bank, the landlord, the solicitor, and HMRC — each independently, without the account holder needing to request separate confirmation letters.

**Self-Verification:** Confirming that your own address records are correct before submitting them. Catches errors in the provider's records before they cause problems downstream.

**Immigration & Visa Applications:** Many visa categories require proof of UK/local address. A verified utility confirmation from a known provider's domain is stronger than an unverifiable PDF.

## Third-Party Use

**Banks & Financial Institutions**
**KYC/AML Compliance:** Banks are required to verify customer addresses for anti-money-laundering compliance. Currently this means eyeballing PDFs or paying third-party data providers. A direct hash check against the utility provider's domain is cryptographically stronger and costs less.

**Background Checking Organisations**
**Streamlined Address History:** Firms like Experian, Equifax, Sterling, and First Advantage currently verify addresses through credit bureau data, electoral roll lookups, or manual document review. Live Verify gives them a direct channel to the authoritative source — the utility provider who actually sends mail to that address. This collapses a multi-step, multi-day process into a single hash lookup. Background checkers processing thousands of checks daily would see significant throughput gains.

**Landlords & Letting Agents**
**Tenant Screening:** Verifying that a prospective tenant actually lives where they claim. A verified address from a utility provider's domain is harder to fake than a PDF bill.

**Government Agencies**
**Benefits & Services:** DWP, HMRC, local councils — all require address verification for benefits, tax, voter registration. Direct verification against a utility provider eliminates reliance on self-declared addresses.

**Solicitors & Conveyancers**
**Property Transactions:** Verifying that the person selling a property actually lives there. Address fraud in property transactions costs millions annually.

**Employers**
**Right-to-Work Checks:** Some employment checks require address confirmation. HR departments can verify instantly rather than filing photocopied bills.

## The Utility Bill Fraud Problem

Utility bills are the weakest link in address verification:

- **PDF forgery:** Templates for every major UK utility are available online. Change the name and address, export as PDF, done. Even experienced compliance officers struggle to spot good forgeries.
- **Screenshot manipulation:** Mobile screenshots of utility apps are trivially editable.
- **Borrowed bills:** Using a friend's or relative's bill at the correct address but wrong name, then editing the name.
- **Expired accounts:** Presenting bills from closed accounts as proof of current address.
- **Address harvesting:** Stealing bills from letterboxes or bins to use as proof of address for fraud.

Live Verify stops all of these because the hash resolves against the provider's domain. A forged PDF won't hash to anything the provider has published. A closed account will return "Closed" status. A stolen bill used by someone else fails because the third party sees the issuer-attested name, not just whatever's printed on the document.

## Verification Architecture

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Energy Providers:** British Gas, EDF, SSE, Octopus Energy, OVO, Scottish Power, and equivalents in other countries.
**Telco Providers:** BT, Sky, Virgin Media, Vodafone, Three, EE, and equivalents.
**Water Companies:** Thames Water, Severn Trent, United Utilities, and equivalents.
**Council Tax:** Local authorities issuing council tax bills.

**Privacy Salt:** Critical for this use case. The combination of a common name and a residential address has very low entropy. The issuer must include a random salt per account (or per statement period) to prevent rainbow-table attacks against the endpoint. The salt appears on the statement so the legitimate verifier can reconstruct the hash, but is not guessable by an attacker who doesn't possess the document.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Institutional

```
✓ britishgas.co.uk/address — Energy provider confirming account holder address
✓ bt.com/address — Telco confirming account holder address
✓ thameswater.co.uk/address — Water company confirming account holder address
```

Trust derives from the utility provider's institutional authority. They know where they send bills because they operate the billing system.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## International Equivalents

| Country | Common Issuers | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **UK** | British Gas, BT, Thames Water, council tax offices | Utility bills are the standard KYC address proof; Ofgem/Ofcom regulate providers |
| **USA** | Con Edison, AT&T, Comcast, PG&E, local water authorities | PATRIOT Act KYC requirements; utility bills widely accepted for address verification |
| **Canada** | Hydro-Québec, Bell, Rogers, Enbridge | Provincial utility regulators; bills accepted for federal ID applications |
| **Australia** | AGL, Origin Energy, Telstra, local water authorities | 100-point ID system accepts utility bills; ACMA regulates telcos |
| **Germany** | E.ON, Telekom, Stadtwerke (municipal utilities) | Meldebescheinigung (registration certificate) is primary; utility bills secondary |
| **France** | EDF, Orange, Veolia | Justificatif de domicile required for most administrative procedures |
| **India** | BSNL, Jio, state electricity boards | Aadhaar is primary but utility bills remain common for address proof |
| **South Africa** | Eskom, Telkom, municipal utilities | FICA requires proof of address for financial account opening |

## Competition vs. Existing Address Verification

| Feature | Live Verify | Credit Bureau Data (Experian etc.) | Manual Document Review |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fraud Resistance** | **High.** Hash resolves against the utility's own domain. | **Medium.** Data is aggregated and can be stale or incomplete. | **Low.** PDFs are trivially forged. |
| **Speed** | **Seconds.** Hash lookup. | **Seconds.** API call. | **Hours-days.** Manual review queue. |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Static hosting. | **High.** Per-lookup fees from data providers. | **High.** Staff time. |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Status reflects current account state. | **Weeks-months.** Credit data updates on reporting cycles. | **Point-in-time.** Whatever the bill date says. |
| **Coverage** | **Any provider with a domain.** | **Limited to reporting providers.** Many smaller utilities don't report. | **Universal but unreliable.** |

**Why this remains strong:** Credit bureau address data is a proxy — it reflects what providers *reported* weeks or months ago. Live Verify is a direct check against the provider's own current records. In this domain, that issuer-side confirmation is the native source of truth rather than a replacement for some better central system.
