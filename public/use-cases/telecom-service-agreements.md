## What are Telecom SLAs?

In the business world, connectivity is oxygen. A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is the contract that defines the quality of that connectivity—specifically the "Uptime Guarantee" (e.g., 99.99%). If the service drops below that level, the provider owes the customer money (SLA Credits).

The problem is that these agreements are often buried in 50-page PDFs. During a dispute, a provider might point to a "Standard SLA" on their website that is much weaker than the "Premium SLA" the customer actually signed. Similarly, a customer might "edit" their SLA to claim a higher credit for a minor outage. Verified hashes bind the **Uptime Percentages, Credit Formulas, and Contract Terms** to the provider's domain (e.g., `verizon.com` or `aws.amazon.com`).

CORE PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Network Availability:                                       99.995%
Latency (Round Trip):                                        < 35ms
Packet Delivery:                                            > 99.9%
Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):                                 4 Hours

SLA CREDITS: Failures to meet Availability targets result in a
10% credit of the monthly recurring charge (MRC) for each hour
of downtime, capped at 50% MRC per month.

## Data Verified

Contract reference number, account number, customer name, service type (Fiber/MPLS/Cloud), availability percentage (uptime), latency/jitter targets, MTTR (repair time), credit formula, effective date, contract term length.

**Document Types:**
- **Master Service Agreement (MSA):** The overarching legal framework.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** The technical performance addendum.
- **Service Order Form (SOF):** The specific pricing and location detail.
- **Outage Incident Report:** Proof of downtime for credit claims.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`verizon.com`, `att.com`, `aws.amazon.com`) and the contract standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Verified** — Contract is current and terms are as stated.
- **Amended** — **ALERT:** Terms have been updated (e.g., a mid-term upgrade).
- **Expired** — Contract term has lapsed; service may be month-to-month.
- **In Dispute** — **ALERT:** The provider or customer has flagged this contract for legal review.

## Second-Party Use

The **Enterprise IT Manager (Customer)** benefits from verification.

**SLA Credit Enforcement:** After a 6-hour network outage, the IT manager scans their verified SLA. They can prove to their own CFO exactly what credits the company is owed, without needing to dig through paper files or wait for the provider's "Account Manager" to confirm the terms.

**Vendor Management:** When comparing multiple providers (e.g., Verizon vs. AT&T), the manager can maintain a verified library of SLAs to ensure that performance actually matches the "Sales Pitch."

## Third-Party Use

**Business Interruption Insurers**
**Claims Validation:** A company files a $1M insurance claim for lost revenue during a data center outage. The insurer scans the company's SLA to verify if the provider was legally responsible for the uptime and if any "Force Majeure" clauses were active.

**Corporate M&A Auditors**
**Due Diligence:** During the acquisition of a company, the buyer scans the verified SLAs of all critical vendors to ensure the target company has the "Enterprise-Grade" protections they claim to have.

**Regulators (FCC / Ofcom)**
**Public Reliability Audit:** Aggregating verified SLA hashes from outage reports to determine if a carrier is systemically failing to meet their advertised performance standards.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fine Print" Fraud Problem**

- **Goal Inflation:** Changing an "SLA Goal" of 99.9% to 99.999% on a PDF to demand higher credits.
- **Term Tampering:** Editing a 12-month contract into a 36-month contract to hide a scheduled price hike.
- **Exclusion Removal:** Deleting the "Maintenance Window" exception from the SLA so that scheduled downtime counts toward a credit claim.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Telecom Carriers.**
**Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).**
**Managed Service Providers (MSPs).**

**Privacy Salt:** High. Contract pricing and network locations are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Contract Harvesting" by competitors.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Telecom service agreements are issued by regulated carriers and SLAs are enforced by the UK communications authority.

```
✓ contract.bt.com/verify — Issues telecom service agreements and SLA documents
  ✓ ofcom.org.uk — Regulates UK communications services
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

SLAs are the "Insurance Policy" of the digital age. By turning complex legal terms into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that both providers and customers are held to the exact standard they agreed to at the moment of signing.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive service providers' hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (contract reference number, account number, customer name, service type, availability percentage, latency/jitter targets, MTTR, credit formula, effective date, contract term length) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the Service Level Agreement.
