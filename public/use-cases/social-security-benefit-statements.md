## What is a Social Security Statement?

A **Social Security Benefit Statement** (such as the SSA-1099 or the "Your Social Security Statement" PDF) is the official government record of your lifetime earnings and your future retirement, disability, and survivor benefits.

It is the primary document used for **Income Verification**:
1.  **Lending:** Proving stable income for a mortgage or car loan.
2.  **Housing:** Demonstrating eligibility for senior or subsidized apartments.
3.  **Legal:** Calculating alimony or child support in family court.

**"Benefit Padding"** is a common financial fraud where applicants "edit" their SSA PDF to show a higher monthly benefit (e.g., changing $1,200 to $3,200) to qualify for a larger loan. The strongest architecture is still the SSA's own account and benefit-verification systems where a verifier can use them directly. Live Verify is more plausible as a bridge when the PDF or mailed letter is already the artifact being shared outside the SSA workflow.

## Data Verified

Beneficiary name, SSN (last 4), Monthly benefit amount (Gross/Net), Type of benefit (Retirement/Disability/SSI), Date of birth, Effective date of last COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment), Residential address, Issuing office ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Benefit Verification Letter:** The primary "Proof of Income" form.
- **SSA-1099 / 1042S:** The annual tax statement.
- **Lifetime Earnings Record:** Summarizing every year of work history.
- **Notice of Award:** Initial approval of benefits.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`ssa.gov`) and current benefit status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active/Paying** — Benefits are current and verified.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Benefits paused (e.g., due to incarceration or work limits).
- **Terminated** — **ALERT:** Person has reached a limit or is deceased.
- **COLA Updated** — Shows the new amount after the annual January adjustment.

## Second-Party Use

The **Beneficiary** benefits from verification.

**Mortgage / Car Loans:** Proving to a lender that their $2,450 income is a verified, stable, government-backed asset. This is strongest when the lender is working from the beneficiary's letter/PDF rather than a direct SSA-integrated channel.

**Housing Applications:** Speeding up approval for senior housing or subsidized apartments by providing a bridge from the letter/PDF back to current SSA status, instead of relying on the paper alone.

## Third-Party Use

**Mortgage Lenders / Underwriters**
**Income Vetting:** Before approving a loan, the bank scans the SSA letter. "Verified by ssa.gov" ensures the borrower hasn't "photoshopped" a $1,000 benefit into a $3,000 one to meet debt-to-income requirements.

**Landlords**
**Occupancy Vetting:** Instantly verifying that a prospective tenant has the verified government income required to cover the rent, reducing the risk of "Synthetic Identity" or income fraud.

**State Medicaid / SNAP Agencies**
**Benefit Coordination:** Verifying federal income levels to determine eligibility for state-level welfare programs without requiring a manual data-share between state and federal servers.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Statement Padding" Fraud Problem**

- **Amount Inflation:** Editing a $1,200 monthly benefit to read $3,200 to get a high-limit credit card or loan.
- **Type Hiding:** Presenting a "Disability" (SSI) benefit as a "Retirement" benefit to hide a health condition from an employer or insurer.
- **Date Stretching:** Altering a "One-Time Payment" to look like a "Monthly Recurring" benefit.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA).**
**Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).**
**Railroad Retirement Board (RRB).**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Social security data is the most sensitive data in the US. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Mapping" of the population's income by hackers or predatory lenders.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Administers US Social Security benefit statements and payments.

```
✓ ssa.gov/myaccount/verify — Administers US Social Security benefit statements and payments
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. Official Letter by Mail

| Feature | Live Verify | Paper Letter (Standard Mail) | mySocialSecurity Login |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the SSA. | **Physical.** Trust the envelope. | **System-Bound.** |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the $ amount. | **Zero.** Easily forged once opened. | **High.** |
| **Speed** | **Fast bridge from the shared artifact.** | **Very Slow.** Takes 7-10 days to arrive. | **Primary when used directly.** |
| **Availability** | **Useful when the letter/PDF is what is being circulated.** | **Low.** People lose their letters. | **Primary when the beneficiary and verifier can use it directly.** |

**Narrower conclusion:** SSA systems should remain primary where direct use is practical. Live Verify is complementary when the letter or PDF is already the thing being handed to lenders, landlords, or agencies and the verifier needs a lightweight bridge back to current SSA status.
