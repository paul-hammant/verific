## What is a Builder Warranty?

When you buy a brand-new home, the builder provides a **Structural Warranty** (often called a 2-10 warranty). It is a legal promise that:
1.  **Year 1:** The craftsmanship is good.
2.  **Year 2:** The pipes and wires won't fail.
3.  **Year 10:** The foundation won't crack or collapse.

This warranty is a valuable financial asset that stays with the house for 10 years, even if you sell it. Verified warranties ensure that builders (or sellers) aren't lying about coverage to close a deal on a poorly built house.

## Data Verified

Property address, homeowner name (initial), builder name/registration, warranty certificate number, coverage types (Workmanship/Systems/Structural), effective date, expiration date, issuing warranty company.

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Warranty:** The main proof of coverage.
- **Maintenance Log:** Proving mandatory homeowner maintenance was performed (linked hash).
- **Claim Approval Notice:** Confirming a structural fix is authorized.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`2-10.com`, `tollbrothers.com`) and current warranty standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Property is currently under warranty.
- **Transferred** — Warranty has been moved to a second owner (Resale).
- **Expired** — Coverage period has ended.
- **In-Litigation** — Warranty disputed in court.

## Second-Party Use

The **Homeowner** benefits from verification.

**Resale Value:** When selling a 5-year-old home, the owner can provide a "Verified Structural Warranty" to the buyer. This proves that the remaining 5 years of the 10-year structural coverage is legitimate and transferable, increasing the home's value.

**Contractor Disputes:** If a pipe bursts in year 2, the homeowner can verify their "Systems Coverage" before calling a plumber, ensuring the builder is held responsible for the cost.

## Third-Party Use

**Prospective Home Buyers**
**Due Diligence:** Before signing a contract on a resale home, the buyer can scan the warranty certificate provided by the seller. Verification ensures the builder didn't quietly cancel the warranty due to a prior dispute or non-payment.

**Real Estate Agents**
**Listing Accuracy:** Ensuring that the "Warranty Included" claim in the MLS listing is backed by a verified cryptographic proof.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Risk Management:** Lenders for new construction often require proof of a 10-year structural warranty before funding. Verification provides the "Final Truth" needed for the closing package.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Ghost Warranty" Fraud Problem**

- **Builder Insolvency:** A builder who has gone bankrupt might still provide unbacked "Warranty" papers to close a sale. Verification shows the warranty isn't active in the insurer's database.
- **Term Alteration:** Editing a "1-year" warranty PDF to read "10-years" to hide structural defects from a buyer.
- **Address Swapping:** Taking a valid warranty for a high-quality build and editing the address to cover a poor-quality "flip" house.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Warranty Administrators:** (2-10 Home Buyers Warranty, Residential Warranty Company).
**National Builders:** (Toll Brothers, Lennar, D.R. Horton).
**Insurance Carriers:** (Who backstop the builder's promises).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

NHBC administers warranty programs that protect homebuyers against structural defects.

```
✓ warranty.nhbc.co.uk — Issues new-build home warranties
  ✓ nhbc.co.uk — Warranties new-build homes in the UK
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the warranty it issued.


## Competition vs. Home Inspection Reports

| Feature | Live Verify | Home Inspection (Visual) | Builder Website Portal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Legal Promise*. | **Subjective.** Relies on what the inspector can *see*. | **Hard.** Requires login/password. |
| **Duration** | **10-20 Years.** Matches the legal statute. | **Snapshot.** Only valid for the day of inspection. | **Ephemeral.** Portals change. |
| **Transfer** | **Easy.** Proves transferability to next owner. | **N/A.** | **Hard.** New owner has no login. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Persistence. A builder warranty is a "Long-Tail" financial asset. The person who needs to verify it in year 9 (the second owner) is almost never the person who received it in year 1. Live Verify turns the persistent piece of paper in the "Homeowner's Binder" into a real-time link to the insurer, regardless of who currently owns the house.
