## Data Verified

Corporate name, resolution text (digest), date of action, names of directors/officers signing, type of action (Unanimous Written Consent vs. Meeting Minutes), jurisdiction of incorporation.

**Document Types:**
- **Unanimous Written Consent:** Signed by all directors without a meeting.
- **Board Meeting Minutes:** Summary of a formal meeting.
- **Secretary's Certificate:** Certification that a resolution is true and in effect.
- **Officer's Certificate:** For high-level corporate actions (e.g., IPO).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., the Corporation or its primary Law Firm) and current status.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Effect** — Resolution is valid and has not been rescinded.
- **Superseded** — A later resolution has modified or replaced this one.
- **Rescinded** — The Board has formally cancelled this action.
- **Void** — Action determined to be ultra vires or legally invalid.

## Second-Party Use

The **Corporation** benefits from verification.

**Bank Account Opening:** Proving to a bank that the "Resolution to Open Account" isn't a fake PDF created by a rogue employee, but is an official board-sanctioned document.

**Real Estate Closing:** Proving to a title company that the officers signing the deed have the verified authority from the Board to sell the property.

**M&A Due Diligence:** Providing a "Verified Minute Book" to a buyer, reducing the thousands of hours lawyers spend manually confirming signatures and corporate actions.

## Third-Party Use

**Investment Banks / Underwriters**
**IPO Due Diligence:** Ensuring every major corporate milestone (funding rounds, stock grants) has a verified, timestamped board resolution, preventing "Founders Disputes" later.

**Commercial Lenders**
**Authority Verification:** Confirming that the people signing a $100M loan agreement are the actual authorized representatives of the company.

**Landlords / Lessors**
**Lease Signing:** Verifying the "Corporate Authority" of the person signing a 10-year commercial lease.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Backdated Resolution" Fraud Problem**

- **Retroactive Grants:** Issuing stock options today but "resolving" them at last year's lower price (Stock Option Backdating). Verification timestamps prevent this.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** A CEO fabricating a resolution to sell a company asset without Board knowledge.
- **Phantom Directors:** Creating a resolution signed by non-existent or "straw" directors to bypass governance.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Corporations:** (Hosting on their own internal IR/Legal domain).
**Law Firms:** (e.g., WSGR, Fenwick, Cooley - hosting on behalf of clients).
**Equity Platforms:** (e.g., Carta, Pulley - who manage the cap table and resolutions).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Corporations issue board resolutions and written consents to document their own internal governance decisions. Self-authorized by company bylaws and corporate law.

```
✓ corporate.example-corp.com/resolution/verify — Issues board resolutions and written consents
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the corporation's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the board resolution.


## Competition vs. Corporate Registries (Delaware SOS)

| Feature | Live Verify | Secretary of State (SOS) | Virtual Data Room (VDR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Granularity** | **High.** Verifies specific *resolutions*. | **Low.** SOS only tracks broad status (e.g., Good Standing). | **Full.** But requires gated access. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Law Firm/Corp. | **Gov-Bound.** | **System-Bound.** Trust the VDR vendor. |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** SOS filings/searches cost fees. | **High.** VDRs cost thousands/month. |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** PDFs stay verifiable anywhere. | **Siloed.** | **Restricted.** Access usually revoked post-deal. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Specificity. A "Certificate of Good Standing" from Delaware only says the company exists. It doesn't say "The Board authorized the sale of the factory." Live Verify turns the **Private Resolution** into a verifiable artifact that can be shared with banks and buyers without exposing the entire secret minute book.
