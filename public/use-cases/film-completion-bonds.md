## What is a Film Completion Bond?

If an independent film (like a $12M epic) runs out of money or the director gets sick halfway through, the investors could lose everything. A **Completion Bond** is the "Guarantee" that the movie will be finished and delivered.

If the movie goes over budget, the **Bonder** pays the difference. In extreme cases, the Bonder can even "Fire the Director" and take over the set to finish the film.

No bank will lend money to a film set without seeing a verified bond. Fraudsters often use fake bond papers to trick naive investors into funding "Vapor-ware" movies.

## Data Verified

Film title, production company name, total guaranteed budget, bond ID number, guarantor name, beneficiary (lender) name, effective date, anticipated delivery date, issuing office location.

**Document Types:**
- **Completion Guaranty:** The primary "Trust" document for investors.
- **Notice of Delivery:** Proving the bond obligations were met.
- **Intercut Guarantee:** For co-productions between two countries.
- **Strike/Cast Insurance Letter:** (Linked hash) proving secondary coverage.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`filmfinances.com`, `europeancinema.eu`) and current bond standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In Force** — Bond is active; project is under guarantee.
- **Closed** — Film completed and delivered; liability discharged.
- **Takeover Active** — **ALERT:** Guarantor has seized control of production to finish the film.
- **Void** — Misrepresentation found; bond cancelled.

## Second-Party Use

The **Film Producer** benefits from verification.

**Unlocking Capital:** Proving to a bank or private equity group that the $12.5M budget is "Verified Bonded." No lender will wire millions to a film set without 100% certainty that a completion bond is in place. A verified hash allows for instant funding releases.

**Distributor Confidence:** Proving to an international distributor (e.g., A24 or Neon) that the film they just pre-bought is verified to be finished on time and on budget.

## Third-Party Use

**Entertainment Banks / Lenders**
**Loan Compliance:** Instantly verifying that the "Completion Bond" in the closing package isn't a fake document created by a desperate producer. This prevents "Paperwork Scams" in the high-risk world of indie film finance.

**Production Insurance Underwriters**
**Risk Aggregation:** Verifying that the project's primary completion bond is active before binding secondary "Cast" or "Essential Elements" insurance.

**Talent Agencies**
**Pay Assurance:** Verifying that a high-profile actor's salary is backed by a bonded production before the actor arrives on set.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Incomplete Epic" Fraud Problem**

- **Fabricated Bonds:** Producers creating fake "Completion Certificates" from reputable firms to trick naive investors into funding a project.
- **Budget Tampering:** Editing a $1M bond to read $10M to match a fraudulent bank loan application.
- **Cancellation Concealment:** Hiding the fact that the guarantor has already issued a "Notice of Rescission" due to the director's health or budget mismanagement.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Completion Guarantors:** (Film Finances Inc, European Film Bonds).
**Specialty Brokers:** (e.g., Gallagher, Marsh).
**Entertainment Law Firms:** (Managing the escrow/bond nexus).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Film Finances underwrites film and media production completion bonds globally.

```
✓ completion.filmfinances.com/verify — Underwrites film and media production completion bonds
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK surety and bond providers
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the completion guarantor's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (bond number, production company name, guaranteed budget, approved screenplay reference, delivery schedule, bond issue date, expiration date) — never plaintext production details — providing non-repudiation of the film completion bond.


## Competition vs. Legal "Opinion Letters"

| Feature | Live Verify | Attorney Opinion Letter | Scanned PDF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Guarantor. | **Credential-Bound.** Trust the lawyer. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires 3-5 days of billable legal review. | **Instant.** |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **Very High.** Lawyers charge $1,000+ per letter. | **None.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows "Takeover" status today. | **Snapshot.** Only valid for the day it was written. | **Static.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Fast-Paced Set" reality. Film finance is chaotic. Decisions to release "Day-of-Shoot" funds happen at 4 AM. Live Verify turns the **Bond Certificate** into a live digital checkpoint, ensuring that the multimillion-dollar "Safety Net" is actually under the tightrope before the cameras roll.
