## What is a Discharge Summary?

When a patient leaves the hospital, they receive a **Discharge Summary**. This is the "User Manual" for their recovery.

It lists:
1.  **The Diagnosis:** "Why were you here?"
2.  **The Meds:** "What new drugs must you take starting today?"
3.  **The Plan:** "When is your next surgery?"

This paper is the #1 tool for preventing "Medical Errors" when a patient moves to a nursing home or goes back to their primary doctor. Verified summaries ensure that a patient (or a family member) doesn't accidentally "Edit" the medication list, which can be fatal.

## Framing Insights

**Specific consequences (Pattern E):** Medication errors during care transitions are the number one cause of preventable hospital readmissions. A patient discharged on warfarin (blood thinner) whose summary is altered — intentionally or accidentally — to omit that medication will not have it reconciled at the nursing home. They develop a blood clot. They are readmitted or they die. The discharge summary is the single document that travels with the patient across the care boundary, and it is currently an unverifiable piece of paper.

**"Why would you bother?" (Pattern A):** Patients and families edit discharge summaries more often than clinicians realize. A patient removes "Alcohol Dependency" before showing the summary to a new GP. A family member deletes "Psychiatric Consultation" before sending it to an employer. A patient adds an opioid to the medication list to obtain it from a new pharmacy. None of these edits are detectable from the paper alone.

## Data Verified

Patient name, MRN (Medical Record Number), admission/discharge dates, primary diagnosis, list of new medications (dose/frequency), follow-up requirements, attending physician name, facility ID.

**Document Types:**
- **Discharge Summary:** The formal medical history of the stay.
- **Discharge Instructions:** Patient-friendly "To-Do" list.
- **Medication Reconciliation:** List of what to take vs. what to stop.
- **Care Plan:** For home health or skilled nursing facilities.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cedars-sinai.org`, `mayoclinic.org`) and the record standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final** — Summary is complete and verified by the attending physician.
- **Amended** — A correction was issued (e.g., due to a medication change).
- **In-Progress** — Patient discharged but final summary pending.
- **Void** — Record assigned to wrong patient (rare safety event).

## Second-Party Use

The **Patient / Caregiver** benefits from verification.

**Safe Transitions:** Proving to a home-health nurse or a retail pharmacist that the "New Medications" on the paper aren't a typo or a misprint. A verified list reduces the chance of "Medication Errors," which are the #1 cause of hospital re-admissions.

**Personal Health Records:** Carrying a verified, cryptographically trusted "Source of Truth" about their hospital stay, which can be shared with future doctors anywhere in the world.

## Third-Party Use

**Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)**
**Intake Integrity:** When a patient arrives from the hospital, the SNF nurse scans the discharge summary. "Verified by Cedars-Sinai" ensures the instructions weren't "Modified" by a family member to hide a contagious condition or a complex wound care requirement.

**Primary Care Physicians (PCPs)**
**Continuity of Care:** PCP offices often wait days for hospital faxes. Live Verify allows them to instantly trust the paper instructions brought in by the patient at the 7-day follow-up visit.

**Health Insurers**
**Outcome Audits:** Verifying that the care plan was actually followed to determine if a re-admission was "Preventable" or not.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Paper Lag" Fraud Problem**

- **Medication Forgery:** Patients editing a discharge summary to add a prescription for an opioid or to remove a "No Driving" restriction.
- **Condition Concealment:** Deleting mention of "Alcohol Abuse" or "Psychiatric Consult" from a summary before sending it to a new employer or insurer.
- **Phantom Discharges:** Creating a fake summary to justify a 2-week absence from work.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Hospitals & Health Systems:** (Cedars-Sinai, Kaiser, HCA).
**EHR Vendors:** (Epic, Cerner - hosting the hashes on behalf of hospitals).
**Health Information Exchanges (HIEs).**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Medical data is highly sensitive (HIPAA/GDPR). The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" attacks to find specific patient diagnoses.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Hospitals issue discharge summaries under healthcare regulator authority (CQC in the UK).

```
✓ discharge.nhs.uk/verify — Issues discharge summaries and care plans
  ✓ cqc.org.uk — Regulates health and social care services in England
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the hospital's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (patient MRN, admission/discharge dates, primary diagnosis, facility ID) — never patient name, detailed medication lists, or specific clinical notes — providing non-repudiation of the discharge summary issuance.


## Competition vs. Patient Portals / HIEs

| Feature | Live Verify | Patient Portal (Epic) | Health Info Exchange (HIE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Hospital. | **System-Bound.** Requires login. | **Network-Bound.** |
| **User Access** | **Instant.** Scan the paper in the clinic. | **Slow.** Requires patient to log in and share screen. | **Difficult.** Requires clinical integration. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds the *Text*. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **High.** |
| **Cross-System** | **Universal.** Works across any health system. | **Siloed.** Hard to share across different vendors. | **Limited.** Regional only. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Front Line" reality. Doctors in outpatient clinics don't have time to log into 10 different patient portals or wait for a regional HIE to sync. Live Verify turns the **Physical Discharge Packet** (which the patient always has) into a live, trusted clinical link.
