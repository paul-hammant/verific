## What is a Tax Residency Certificate?

You're a UK company paying dividends to a shareholder who claims to be tax-resident in Switzerland. Under the UK-Switzerland double taxation treaty, withholding tax drops from 15% to 0%. That's a significant sum on a large dividend. The shareholder provides a tax residency certificate — a letter from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration saying they're resident in Switzerland for tax purposes.

Is it real? You're a payroll clerk in Manchester. You've never seen a Swiss tax document before. You don't read German. The certificate could be forged, expired, or issued for a different tax year. If you apply the reduced withholding rate based on a fake certificate, HMRC holds your company liable for the shortfall.

This plays out millions of times annually across every country with tax treaties. Tax residency certificates are the fundamental document of international tax — they determine who pays tax where — and they're routinely unverifiable by the entities that need to act on them.

With Live Verify, the certificate carries a `verify:` line bound to the issuing tax authority's domain. The paying company scans it and gets confirmation from the Swiss, French, German, or US tax authority that yes, this person or entity is tax-resident in their jurisdiction for the stated period.

## Data Verified

Taxpayer name, taxpayer identification number (TIN), country of residence, tax year(s) covered, issuing tax authority, date issued, treaty applicability (which bilateral treaty). NOT included: income amounts, tax paid, detailed tax returns.

## Verification Response

- **VALID** — Certificate is authentic and covers the stated tax year
- **EXPIRED** — Certificate was for a prior tax year and the current year has not been certified
- **REVOKED** — Tax authority withdrew the certificate (residency determination changed)
- **SUPERSEDED** — A more recent certificate has been issued
- **404** — No matching record

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the certificate itself (e.g., `estv.admin.ch`).

## Second-Party Use

The **Taxpayer** (individual or entity) is the second party. They receive the certificate from their tax authority and present it to foreign parties.

**Claiming Treaty Benefits on Dividends/Interest:** Providing the certificate to foreign payers to claim reduced withholding rates under bilateral tax treaties. A Swiss company receiving UK dividends presents its ESTV certificate to the UK paying agent to claim the 0% treaty rate instead of the standard 15%.

**Reduced Withholding at Foreign Banks:** Providing to foreign banks to claim reduced withholding on interest and dividend payments. Without the certificate, the bank withholds at the full domestic rate.

**Foreign Government Proceedings:** Providing to foreign governments when claiming treaty residency for immigration or business purposes — proving you're actually resident where you say you are.

**Tax Advisor Confirmation:** Providing to their own tax advisors to confirm residency status, particularly in cases of dual residency or recent relocation where the correct filing position depends on which country considers the taxpayer resident.

## Third-Party Use

**Companies Paying Cross-Border Dividends/Interest/Royalties**
The primary use. A UK company paying a royalty to a German licensor needs the German company's tax residency certificate to apply the treaty rate instead of the standard withholding rate. Get it wrong and HMRC assesses the shortfall plus penalties.

**Banks and Financial Institutions**
Withholding on interest payments to non-residents. A London bank paying interest to a Swiss account holder needs the certificate to apply the reduced treaty rate. Multiply this by millions of cross-border accounts and the verification volume is enormous.

**Tax Authorities in the Other Treaty Country**
Verifying claimed residency when processing tax returns. HMRC reviewing a UK tax return where the filer claims Swiss residency can verify the Swiss certificate directly, without waiting months for a bilateral government-to-government exchange.

**Multinational Employers**
Determining which country's payroll taxes apply. An employee claiming to be tax-resident in Ireland rather than the UK — the employer needs to verify before applying Irish payroll treatment.

**Investment Funds**
Treaty reclaim processing — recovering excess withholding tax. Funds hold securities in dozens of countries and need residency certificates to reclaim the difference between the standard and treaty withholding rates. Billions of dollars in reclaims annually, heavily dependent on certificate authenticity.

**Tax Advisors and Accountants**
Verifying client residency claims before filing cross-border tax returns. Getting it wrong exposes the advisor to professional liability.

## Verification Architecture

**Tax Residency Certificate Fraud**

- **Forged certificates to claim treaty benefits:** The core fraud. Fabricate a residency certificate, present it to a foreign payer, pocket the reduced withholding. The payer has no practical way to verify — especially when the certificate is in a foreign language from a foreign authority they've never dealt with.
- **Certificates from a prior tax year presented as current:** Residency can change year to year. A certificate valid for 2024 means nothing for 2025 if the taxpayer relocated.
- **Treaty shopping:** Routing income through a country with favorable treaties using fabricated residency. Claim to be resident in a country with a 0% withholding treaty when you're actually resident somewhere with a 15% rate. This is the reason tax authorities care most about certificate authenticity.
- **Federal system subdivision fraud:** Certificates issued by one subdivision of a country when the taxpayer is actually resident in another. Relevant for countries like Switzerland (cantonal vs. federal), Germany (Bundesland), and the US (state residency affecting treaty claims).
- **The multilingual problem:** The paying company cannot read the language of the issuing authority. A payroll clerk in Manchester cannot verify whether a certificate in German, Japanese, or Arabic says what the presenter claims it says. Live Verify makes the language irrelevant — the hash verification works regardless of the document's language.
- **Dual residency exploitation:** Person is resident in two countries under each country's domestic law and presents whichever certificate is more favorable depending on the transaction. Treaty tiebreaker rules exist but are only applied if someone actually checks.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

Tax authorities are the sole issuers: HMRC (UK), IRS (US, via Form 6166), Eidgenössische Steuerverwaltung (Switzerland), Bundeszentralamt für Steuern (Germany), Direction Générale des Finances Publiques (France), National Tax Agency (Japan), Agenzia delle Entrate (Italy), Canada Revenue Agency.

## Privacy Salt

**Moderate.** Tax residency is not highly secret — it's declared on tax returns and disclosed to financial institutions routinely. But linking a specific person or entity to a specific tax authority reveals financial activity and cross-border economic connections. Salt prevents enumeration — an attacker who knows a company's TIN format shouldn't be able to probe whether that company holds a residency certificate in a particular jurisdiction.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

HMRC issues tax residency certificates and treaty eligibility declarations under the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010.

```
✓ hmrc.gov.uk/tax-residency/verify — HMRC tax residency certificate and treaty eligibility service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition

| Feature | Live Verify | Apostille | Direct Contact with Foreign Tax Authority | Trust the Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Proves Content** | **Yes.** Hash of full certificate text verified against issuer. | **No.** Proves the signature is genuine, not that the content is accurate or current. | **Yes.** But months, not seconds. | **No.** Paper proves nothing. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Days to weeks to obtain. | **Months.** Bilateral government channels exist but are bureaucratic. | **Instant.** But no verification occurs. |
| **Language-Independent** | **Yes.** Hash works regardless of document language. | **No.** Apostille itself may need translation. | **Depends.** Correspondence in the other authority's working language. | **No.** You still can't read it. |
| **Current Status** | **Yes.** Real-time status (VALID/EXPIRED/REVOKED). | **No.** Apostille is point-in-time. Certificate may have been revoked since. | **Yes.** But you'll find out in three months. | **No.** No way to know if it's still valid. |
| **Treaty Requirement** | **None.** Works for any treaty country. | **Varies.** Many tax treaties don't require apostille. | **Requires bilateral channels.** Not available to private companies. | **Default.** And the reason treaty fraud persists. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The current default is trusting the paper. Apostilles prove the signature but not the content — a genuine certificate for the wrong tax year still carries a valid apostille. Contacting the foreign tax authority directly is available to governments but not to the companies that actually need to verify certificates before applying withholding rates. Live Verify puts real-time verification in the hands of the payroll clerk who's actually making the withholding decision.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the tax authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (taxpayer TIN, tax year, country of residence, treaty reference, certificate number, issue date) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the tax residency certificate. Tax residency certificates have particular witnessing value for **audit defense** — the witnessing record proves verification occurred at the time of the withholding decision, demonstrating good faith even if the certificate later proves forged.

## Further Derivations

1. **OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) self-certifications** — The form individuals sign declaring their tax residency for automatic exchange of financial account information between countries. Different from the government-issued certificate (it's a self-declaration, not an authority attestation) but addresses a related verification need. Banks collect millions of these annually under CRS and have no way to verify that the declared country of tax residence is accurate. A Live Verify-enabled CRS self-certification could cross-reference the declaration against the individual's actual government-issued residency certificate.
