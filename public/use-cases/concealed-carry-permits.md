## What is a CCW Permit?

A **Concealed Carry Weapon (CCW)** permit is a license issued by a local Sheriff or State Police allowing a citizen to carry a hidden firearm in public.

It proves the person has:
1.  **Passed a Background Check:** No felony convictions or domestic violence history.
2.  **Completed Training:** Knowledge of safety laws and marksmanship.

Police officers at a traffic stop need to verify these permits in seconds. If a permit has been "Revoked" (e.g., after a recent arrest), but the person still has the physical card, it is a major public safety risk. Live Verify provides the "Live Status" check that saves lives.

**Why would you bother verifying?** Because a revoked permit holder carrying a concealed weapon is committing a felony, and the officer has no way to know from the plastic card alone. Permits are revoked for reasons that directly affect safety: domestic violence protective orders, felony charges, mental health commitments. The gap between revocation and physical card surrender can be days, weeks, or indefinite — some jurisdictions have no mechanism to recover the card at all. For the legitimate permit holder, fast verification also matters: it shortens a tense roadside encounter and confirms to the officer that the armed citizen in the vehicle is exactly who they claim to be.

## Data Verified

Permit holder name, photo (hash), date of birth, physical descriptors (height/weight), permit number, issuing county/agency, expiration date, restrictions (e.g., "Handgun only"), training completion status.

**Document Types:**
- **Standard CCW Card:** The pocket ID.
- **Interim Permit:** Temporary 30-day paper proof while card is mailed.
- **Training Certificate:** Proof of passing the mandatory safety class.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`washoesheriff.com`, `lasvegasnevada.gov`) and current permit status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active** — Permit is valid and bearer is eligible to carry.
- **Suspended** — Temporary restriction (e.g., pending legal outcome).
- **Revoked** — Permanently barred from concealed carry (e.g., after felony conviction).
- **Expired** — Renewal required.

## Second-Party Use

The **Permit Holder** benefits from verification.

**Interstate Reciprocity:** When carrying in a "Reciprocal" state (e.g., a Nevada resident in Idaho), the holder can scan their own badge to show local Idaho police that their home-state permit is "Verified Active" on the Nevada Sheriff's domain.

**Firearms Purchase:** Speeding up the background check (NICS) process in states where a verified CCW permit acts as an exemption for the waiting period.

## Third-Party Use

**Law Enforcement (Roadside)**
**Officer Safety:** During a traffic stop, if a driver declares they have a weapon, the officer can scan the CCW card. Instant verification against the Sheriff's domain confirms the driver is a "Verified Safe" law-abiding citizen and not an impostor with a fake ID.

**Private Property Owners (Businesses)**
**Policy Enforcement:** A business owner who allows concealed carry can verify that guests are actually licensed professionals and not just un-vetted individuals.

**Gun Range Safety Officers**
**Insurance Compliance:** Ensuring all shooters on the line with concealed holsters have verified, current safety training and permits.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Permit" Fraud Problem**

- **Identity Swapping:** A person with a criminal record using a "Clean" person's ID and editing the photo.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A permit holder who has had their rights revoked (e.g., after a domestic violence incident) keeping their physical card to show police.
- **Fabricated Permits:** Criminals creating fake "Permits" to carry illegal weapons in public without being arrested if stopped.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**County Sheriffs:** (In most "Shall-Issue" states).
**State Police:** (In "State-Issue" jurisdictions).
**Department of Public Safety (DPS).**

**Privacy Salt:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. Firearms data is highly sensitive and politicized. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches of the entire county population to see who owns a gun.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Issues concealed carry weapons permits after background checks.

```
✓ sheriff.county.gov/ccw/verify — Issues concealed carry weapons permits after background checks
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuing authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers and dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the permit.
## Competition vs. Police Database (NCIC)

| Feature | Live Verify | NCIC / NLETS (Police DB) | Physical Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Open.** Citizens and businesses can verify. | **Zero.** Only police have access. | **Manual.** Just looking. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds photo to status. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Low.** Easily faked. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires dispatcher or laptop query. | **Instant.** |
| **Cross-State** | **Seamless.** Works via URL. | **Complex.** State-to-state data sharing is often laggy. | **Hard.** Officers can't recognize 50 different state cards. |

**Narrower conclusion:** Police and licensing databases should remain primary for official enforcement and adjudication. Live Verify is more credible as a complementary bridge when an officer, dealer, or range staff member only has the physical permit in hand and lacks a practical direct path into the issuing state's system.
