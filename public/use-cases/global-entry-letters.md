## What is Global Entry Status?

**Global Entry** is a "Trusted Traveler" program that allows pre-vetted, low-risk travelers to skip the long lines at US Customs when returning from abroad. It also includes **TSA PreCheck** for domestic flights.

To get it, you must pass a rigorous federal background check and a face-to-face interview with a Customs officer. The **Membership Confirmation** is your proof of status.

But Global Entry is already a government-held status record. The main question is not whether the letter's text is authentic in isolation; it is whether the official Trusted Traveler status is active now. That makes this a weak fit for standalone document verification and a better fit for direct official status checks.

## Data Verified

Member name, PASSID (Membership #), program type (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, TSA PreCheck), status (Approved/Conditional/Revoked), Known Traveler Number (KTN), effective date, expiration date, issuing agency (CBP).

**Document Types:**
- **Membership Approval Letter:** The standard PDF for new members.
- **Conditional Approval Notice:** For scheduling interviews.
- **Revocation Notice:** (Linked hash) proving membership has been terminated.
- **KTN Confirmation:** For employer or airline travel profiles.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cbp.dhs.gov`) and current membership standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved** — Member is verified and eligible for expedited processing.
- **Conditional** — Background check passed; interview pending.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** Membership terminated due to recent violation or arrest.
- **Expired** — Renewal required.

## Second-Party Use

The **Trusted Traveler** benefits from verification.

**Travel Booking:** Proving to an employer or travel agent that a Known Traveler Number is current, while treating the official TTP system as the actual authority.

**Administrative Convenience:** The letter can support narrow human workflows around current membership status. It should not be treated as a substitute for a proper background check.

## Third-Party Use

**Airline Counter Agents**
If they need a status check at all, the stronger answer is direct access to the official TTP state. A verified letter would only be a convenience layer.

**TSA Officers (Security Checkpoint)**
Official checkpoint systems should remain primary. A printed letter or itinerary should not become the main trust artifact.

**International Employers**
At most, the letter can support a narrow convenience check that the person holds current Trusted Traveler status. It should not be treated as a broad substitute for a background check.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Trusted Traveler" Fraud Problem**

- **Status Fabrication:** Scammers creating fake "Global Entry Approved" PDFs to trick employers into skipping a background check.
- **Revocation Hiding:** A traveler who was caught smuggling (leading to revocation) keeping their physical card or old PDF to use PreCheck lanes.
- **PASSID Tampering:** Editing the "Expiration Date" on an old 2024 letter to make it look like a 2026 approval.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):** The sole U.S. issuer.
**Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA):** (For NEXUS co-branded letters).
**DHS TTP Portal:** (The digital record source).

**Privacy Salt:** Critical. PASSIDs and names are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Guess-and-Check" searches of the traveler database.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Enrolls and verifies trusted traveler program members.

```
✓ ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/verify — Enrolls and verifies trusted traveler program members
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive CBP's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (member names, PASSIDs, program types, membership status, expiration dates) — never sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the Trusted Traveler status.

## Competition vs. TTP Online Portal

| Feature | Live Verify | TTP Official Portal | Physical TTP Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Passport to Status.** | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Mechanical.** Prone to forgery. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Slow.** Requires 2FA, login, and navigation. | **Instant.** |
| **Field Access** | **High.** Works for airlines/employers. | **Zero.** Third parties never get TTP logins. | **Visual.** Trusted only via logo. |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to `cbp.dhs.gov`. | **High.** | **Medium.** |

**Practical conclusion:** Global Entry is mainly a direct-official-status problem. The stronger answer is easier access to the TTP system for the relying party or a simpler official status page, not elevating the confirmation letter into a primary trust artifact.
