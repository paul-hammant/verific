# Sovereign Roots: The Anchor List That Makes Authority Chains Mean Something

## Why this list has to exist

The [authority chain](authority-chain-spec.md) lets a verifier walk `authorizedBy` links from an
issuer upward to a root. The [app-display](authority-chain-app-display.md) doc shows how that walk
is rendered. But a chain that can terminate *anywhere* answers no question worth asking.

Consider the attack. A fraudster registers three domains and has them endorse each other:

```
✓ warrant-cards.example.com — Issues UK police warrant cards
  ✓ police-oversight.example.net — Regulates UK police credentials
    ✓ official-uk-verification-registry.org — UK government root namespace
```

Every node returns HTTP 200. Every `authorizedBy` link resolves. The chain is internally
consistent and the app would render it just as handsomely as the real
`elmstreetmedical.nhs.uk → gmc-uk.org → gov.uk` chain. The fraudster controls all three domains,
so they can make the endpoints say anything — including that the top one is "the UK government
root namespace."

**Without a known-roots list, the authority-chain UI is not neutral — it is worse than nothing,
because it manufactures trust theater.** It makes "somewhere" look official. A chain display only
means something if the app can answer one question the chain itself cannot answer: *does this chain
terminate at a root that is actually sovereign?* That answer cannot come from walking the chain —
the root is the one node that cannot prove itself by reference to anything higher (`gov.uk` is the
UK Government because it is). It has to come from a list the app already holds.

This is not optional hardening layered on top of the authority-chain feature. **It is the
precondition for shipping the authority-chain feature at all.** An app that renders chains without
anchoring them should not render them.

## The precedent: this is a root store, not an invention

The shape of this artifact is already familiar, and this project already depends on two instances
of it:

- **Browsers ship a CA root store** — roughly 150 curated trust anchors. A TLS certificate means
  "verified" only because it chains to one of them. The exact same logic applies here.
- **This repo already embeds the Public Suffix List** (see `public/domain-authority.js`) — a
  public, versioned, community-maintained list of ~10,000 entries that ships in every browser and
  in this project's apps via the same `sync-shared` path.

A sovereign-roots list is the same *kind* of artifact: public, versioned, diffable, PR-able, and
bundled into the apps. The PSL precedent also answers the governance question before it is asked —
see [Governance](#governance-maintained-like-the-psl-not-by-an-anointed-authority) below.

## It's namespace rules, not "200 domains"

The naive framing — "hardcode ~200 sovereign domains" — is wrong in a way that matters. In most
countries the root is not one domain but a **registry-controlled namespace**, and the list is a set
of *patterns plus explicit entries*, not a flat domain list. The categories:

1. **Government namespaces (wildcard).** Where a registry controls an entire suffix and admits only
   government bodies, the rule is a pattern:
   - `*.gov.uk` (GDS controls all `.gov.uk` subdomains)
   - `*.gov` (US — CISA controls the entire `.gov` TLD, so any `.gov` is an anchor without
     enumerating 50 states and thousands of municipalities)
   - `*.gc.ca`, `*.gouv.fr`, `*.bund.de`, `*.gov.au`
2. **Sub-sovereign anchors (the part that grows the list).** Federal countries regulate many
   professions at the state level — the state *is* the sovereign, not the nation (see the
   app-display doc's Federal vs. State section). These need explicit entries:
   - US states: `texas.gov`, `ny.gov`, `california.gov`, … (covered by the `*.gov` wildcard)
   - German Länder: `bayern.de`, `sachsen.de`, … (~16, individually listed — no clean suffix)
   - Australian states, `gov.scot`, `gov.wales`, Indian state/UT domains (~28)
3. **Explicit domains where there's no clean suffix.** Countries whose government domains don't sit
   under a single registry-controlled suffix need each root listed by hand.
4. **Treaty-based international organisations.** `un.org`, `who.int`, `wipo.int`, `worldbank.org`,
   `europa.eu` — a couple dozen IGOs with a sovereign-equivalent basis.

Realistically a few hundred patterns. Still tiny: the PSL is ~10,000 lines and ships everywhere.
The canonical seed for this list is the two tables already in
[authority-chain-app-display.md](authority-chain-app-display.md#hardcoded-root-trust-anchors) —
this doc is where their format, semantics, and governance are specified; that doc is where the
current contents live until the list is extracted into its own bundled file.

### List format

Each entry is a pattern (or exact domain), a jurisdiction, a type, and the hardcoded description the
app shows when the walk terminates here:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "match": "*.gov.uk",          // suffix wildcard, exact domain, or registry-suffix rule
    "jurisdiction": "GB",         // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (or alpha-2 + region for sub-sovereign)
    "type": "government",         // government | sub-sovereign | igo
    "description": "UK government root namespace",
    "formalName": "Government Digital Service, Cabinet Office"
  },
  {
    "match": "bayern.de",
    "jurisdiction": "DE-BY",
    "type": "sub-sovereign",
    "description": "Bavarian state government",
    "formalName": "Bayerische Staatskanzlei"
  },
  {
    "match": "who.int",
    "jurisdiction": "INT",
    "type": "igo",
    "description": "World Health Organization",
    "formalName": "World Health Organization"
  }
]
```

The `description`/`formalName` for roots are **hardcoded in the list, not fetched** — the root is
the one node whose self-description the app must not trust over its own knowledge. (A captured
`gov.uk` subdomain could otherwise relabel itself.) For every node *below* the root, descriptions
still come from that node's `verification-meta.json` as the app-display doc specifies.

## The list informs; it does not gate

Verification and anchoring are **two separate signals** and the UI must keep them separate:

- **Verification** — "the issuer's domain stands behind this hash right now" (HTTP 200 +
  `{"status":"verified"}`). This is the primary check and is unchanged by any of this.
- **Anchoring** — "that issuer's chain reaches a known sovereign root." A *secondary*, contextual
  signal.

A document can verify perfectly and be legitimately unanchored — a peer reference on
`paulhammant.com/refs` is a real, valid attestation with no government in its chain, by design (the
**Personal** authority pattern). Painting it red would be a category error and would break the
human-in-the-loop principle the homepage and app-display doc both rest on.

### Three states

| State | When | UI treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Anchored** | Chain terminates at an entry in the list | Green. **Name the jurisdiction** — "Anchored to UK government" — not just a checkmark. The jurisdiction is the useful payload. |
| **Unanchored** | Chain terminates at a domain *not* in the list | **Amber, not red.** "This chain ends at `example.com`, which is not a known sovereign root — judge this domain yourself." Correct for personal/commercial issuers. |
| **No chain** | No `authorizedBy` header at all (self-attested) | Neutral. "Self-attested; no authority chain presented." Already covered by the app-display doc's *Absence of Chain*. |

Amber is the important one. It is the state the trust-theater attack lands in: the fraudster's
`official-uk-verification-registry.org` is *not* in the list, so the chain that looked official now
reads "ends at a domain not known to be sovereign — judge it yourself." The attack doesn't get a
green light; it gets a "you're on your own here," which is the honest answer.

### Fail loudly if the list can't load

Per the project's [fail-loudly rule](../LLM.md), if the bundled anchor list cannot be loaded the app
must display **"anchor status unavailable"** and show the chain *without* anchoring claims — never
silently skip the check and render chains as though unanchored, and never fall back to treating
everything as anchored. Absence of the list is a loud, visible condition, not a degraded-but-quiet
one. (No retry/fallback logic added on initiative — surfacing the condition is the whole behaviour.)

## The jurisdiction-mismatch heuristic

The conversation that prompted this doc raised a "geo warning" — *warn the user when they're
physically distant from the root verifier.* The instinct is right; the mechanism has to be precise.

**Compare jurisdictions, not geography.** IP-geolocating the verification endpoint is meaningless —
it resolves to a CDN, not to a ministry. The useful comparison is:

> the chain anchors to jurisdiction **X**; the verifier appears to be in jurisdiction **Y**.

And it must be phrased as **context, not alarm.** A passport at a border, a bill of lading at a
port, a tourist's foreign credentials, an overseas university transcript are all legitimately
foreign-rooted. A blanket "foreign credential!" warning would cry wolf constantly and train users to
dismiss it.

The high-value case is the **in-person power-asymmetry scenario** the
[urgent-verification doc](urgent-verification-framing.md) covers: someone at your Edinburgh door
presenting a warrant card whose chain anchors to a sovereign that **isn't the UK** deserves a
loud, specific prompt — *"This credential is anchored to [jurisdiction X]. Expected?"* — because the
mismatch is exactly the tell in that context.

### Where the "expected" jurisdiction comes from

Critically, **the expected root cannot come from the issuer's own `verification-meta.json`** — a
fraudulent issuer would simply declare itself expected. It has to come from the **verifier's side**:
their own country, inferred at **country granularity** from locale / SIM region / timezone.

- **Never GPS, never fine location.** Country-level inference from locale/SIM/timezone keeps the
  privacy posture intact — no precise-location permission, no tracking, consistent with the rest of
  the system never touching the user's location.
- The signal is "the device thinks it's in country Y," which is all the heuristic needs.
- This is a *prompt*, not a *block*. The app says "anchored to X; you appear to be in Y — expected?"
  and the human decides. It never refuses to display.

## Governance: maintained like the PSL, not by an anointed authority

Who decides what's a sovereign root? If the answer is "a central authority blesses the list," the
standard has quietly reintroduced the single gatekeeper it was designed not to have — the same
disintermediation argument that runs through the rest of this project.

The answer is the **Public Suffix List model**: a public, versioned list in the open, changed by
pull request with documented criteria, reviewed by maintainers, bundled into releases. It is
diffable and auditable; anyone can see exactly which roots an app trusts and challenge an entry.
This is the same governance the [Let's Encrypt precedent](lets-encrypt-precedent.md) identifies as
what lets rival adopters co-trust an artifact — neutrality is what makes shared infrastructure
shareable.

Entry criteria (to be refined as the list forms):

- A government namespace qualifies if a national registry demonstrably restricts it to government
  bodies (the `.gov` / `.gov.uk` property).
- A sub-sovereign entry qualifies where that level is the *actual* sovereign for some regulated
  activity (Texas for attorney admission, Bavaria for bar admission) — not merely a regional
  subdivision.
- An IGO qualifies on a treaty basis with a stable, registry-controlled domain.
- Everything else is **unanchored on purpose** — and unanchored is a fine, common, honest state, not
  a failure.

## The unsolved-but-survivable problem: root compromise and change over time

This must be stated plainly in any design that ships the list, because it is the one genuinely hard
part:

- **Roots change.** Governments rebrand and re-domain. `gov.uk` itself is only ~15 years old; a
  ministry can move, merge, or retire a domain. A compile-time-only list goes stale and starts
  showing amber for chains that are actually fine.
- **Roots can be captured.** A spoofed or compromised ministry subdomain is the exact equivalent of
  a **rogue CA** in the TLS world — a node the list vouches for that an attacker now controls. This
  is not hypothetical; it is the well-understood failure mode of every root store.

The TLS world handles both with the same mechanism: **list updates and revocations**, shipped out of
band from the compile. The implication for Live Verify is concrete:

> The anchor list needs an **update channel in the apps** — not just a compile-time bundle. A
> versioned list with a signed update feed (and the ability to *remove* a captured root quickly),
> on the same footing as how browsers push CA distrust. Build the list as data with an update path
> from day one, not as a constant baked into a release.

This is survivable precisely because it is a solved problem in an adjacent domain — but it is not
free, and a design that bundles the list without an update/revocation channel has shipped a root
store that can never be corrected.

## Takeover detection: compensating for the missing signature (proposal)

> **Status:** design proposal, not implemented.

The base protocol returns an *unsigned* answer, so at lookup time trust reduces to "whoever controls
this domain right now" (see
[cryptographic-foundations.md](cryptographic-foundations.md#what-the-base-protocol-is--and-is-not)). A
signature would let a verifier detect a takeover directly. Absent one, the next-best thing is a system
that makes takeover — and hacker *insertion* short of full takeover — **loud and quickly detectable**,
so a captured issuer or intermediate is caught and pulled from the anchor/endorser graph fast. The
sovereign roots are the natural operators of that system, because they already anchor the chains and
already need an update/revocation channel.

The proposal has three layers, each a continuous integrity check that a root (and every intermediate)
runs on the parties below it:

- **Continuity monitoring per issuer/intermediate.** A root (or an endorser) records a rolling
  fingerprint of each domain it vouches for: the TLS certificate chain and issuing CA, the hosting
  ASN/IP block, the `verification-meta.json` content hash, the DNS delegation, and the set of
  `authorizedBy` links. A takeover almost always changes one of these abruptly — a new CA, a new
  hosting provider, a re-registered domain, a rewritten meta file. An abrupt, uncorroborated change to
  a *previously stable* party is flagged: the anchor/endorser can drop to **amber** ("this issuer's
  infrastructure changed unexpectedly on [date]; treat with caution") pending re-confirmation, rather
  than continuing to vouch green for a node an attacker may now control. This is the CA-world's
  certificate-transparency instinct applied to issuer *infrastructure*.
- **Cross-checking, so one compromised checker is not enough.** No single monitor is trusted. Multiple
  independent parties (peer roots, the endorsers in the chain, third-party witnesses) each run the
  continuity check and **agree** on a party's fingerprint; a change corroborated by many is a genuine
  legitimate migration, while a change one party sees and others do not is the signature of a localized
  compromise (a single hijacked resolver, a single poisoned CDN edge). This directly targets **hacker
  insertion without full takeover** — an attacker who compromises one path to one intermediate, not the
  domain itself — because the honest majority still sees the unchanged fingerprint and the divergence
  surfaces as an alarm.
- **Fast revocation down the graph.** When a takeover or insertion is confirmed, the root removes the
  captured node via the same out-of-band update/revocation channel the section above already requires —
  and, because endorsement is a *graph* (`authorizedBy`), every chain transiting the captured node goes
  amber at once, not just the node itself. The blast radius is bounded by how fast the update feed
  propagates, which is the same latency the CA-distrust mechanism already accepts.

**What this is and is not.** It does **not** turn an unsigned GET into cryptographic evidence — a
verifier still cannot hold a signed, transferable proof, and a *fast, total, simultaneous* takeover of
a domain and all its monitors would still briefly answer as genuine. What it does is shrink the window
in which a captured issuer or intermediate can pass as trusted, and make the common cases (CA change,
re-hosting, meta rewrite, single-path insertion) *detectable* rather than silent. It is a **detection
and containment** layer, not a substitute for the signing/witnessing/Merkle layers those docs describe
— and, like them, it is a proposal here, not shipped.

## Scope: what this doc is and isn't

This is the **design note**. It specifies the list's format, the three-state semantics, the
jurisdiction-mismatch heuristic, PSL-style governance, and the root-compromise/update-channel
requirement.

**Wiring it into the apps is separate, later work:** extracting the seed tables from
[authority-chain-app-display.md](authority-chain-app-display.md) into a bundled data file,
distributing it via the `sync-shared` path alongside the PSL, implementing the three-state amber UI
in the iOS/Android/extension chain renderers, the country-inference heuristic, and the signed update
feed. None of that is built yet. This doc is the spec it should be built against.
