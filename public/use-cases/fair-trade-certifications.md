## What is Fair Trade?

If you see a **Fairtrade Certified** logo on a bag of coffee, it means the farmers in Colombia or Ethiopia were paid a fair price and work in safe conditions.

This "Ethical Premium" is worth billions of dollars. Large retailers (like Starbucks or Whole Foods) only buy from certified cooperatives.

"Greenwashing" is a major fraud: unscrupulous companies often put fake logos on their bags to charge more for "Slave-Labor" coffee. Verified hashes allow a consumer or a grocery store buyer to scan the bag and see the **verified audit status** from the global standard-body's domain instantly.

## Data Verified

Producer cooperative name, Fairtrade ID (FLO ID), specific product certified (e.g., Coffee, Cocoa, Cotton), region of origin, latest audit date, compliance status, certification body (e.g., FLOCERT), expiration date.

**Document Types:**
- **Fairtrade Certificate:** The primary "License to Trade."
- **Ethical Sourcing Audit:** (Linked hash) for B2B supply chain proof.
- **Transaction Certificate:** Proving a specific shipment is certified.
- **Worker Rights Attestation:** For labor-intensive industries.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`fairtrade.net`, `flocert.net`, `rainforest-alliance.org`) and current standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Producer is in good standing and audit is current.
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Non-compliance detected; status paused.
- **Decertified** — Permanently removed from the system due to major violations (e.g., child labor).
- **Expired** — Re-audit overdue.

## Second-Party Use

The **Producer Cooperative** benefits from verification.

**Export Contracts:** Proving to a major coffee buyer (e.g., Starbucks or Nespresso) that their "Fairtrade" claim is verified by FLOCERT. This ensures they receive the "Fairtrade Minimum Price" and the "Fairtrade Premium," which can be worth millions in extra revenue.

**Access to Markets:** Speeding up the onboarding process for high-end European or North American retailers who have strict "Ethical Sourcing" mandates.

## Third-Party Use

**Sustainability Auditors (ESG)**
**Supply Chain Mapping:** Large corporations can verify the hashes of all their producers' certificates to ensure 100% of their "Ethical" supply chain is legitimate, defending against "Greenwashing" accusations.

**Conscious Consumers**
**Retail Trust:** A consumer standing in a grocery store can scan the QR/hash on a bag of coffee. "Verified by Fairtrade.net" provides instant assurance that the ethical claim is real and not just marketing "Greenwash."

**Customs Authorities**
**Tariff Benefits:** In some jurisdictions, "Ethical" goods receive preferential import treatment. Verification provides the legal proof needed for these benefits.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Greenwashing" Fraud Problem**

- **Logo Misuse:** Putting the Fairtrade logo on a non-certified product to charge a premium price.
- **Audit Forgery:** Creating a fake "FLOCERT" audit report to hide unsafe working conditions or under-payment of farmers.
- **Decertification Hiding:** Continuing to use a "Certified" paper certificate after the cooperative has been banned for labor violations.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Standard Bodies:** (Fairtrade International, Rainforest Alliance).
**Auditing Firms:** (FLOCERT, Control Union).
**Corporate Integrity Portals.**

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Fairtrade certifies producers and supply chains that meet ethical sourcing standards.

```
✓ info.fairtrade.net — Issues fair-trade certifications
  ✓ isealalliance.org — Sets global sustainability standards
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the certifying body's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (producer ID, certified product type, production region, audit status, audit number, issue date, expiration date, certifier name) — never plaintext producer contact information — providing non-repudiation of the fair trade certification.


## Competition vs. Public Databases (FLOCERT)

| Feature | Live Verify | FLOCERT Public Search | Static Logo |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Standard Body. | **Database.** Direct from source. | **Zero.** Just a JPEG. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds Audit.** Protects the status. | **Data-Only.** Doesn't verify the paper. | **Vulnerable.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** Scan at the point of sale. | **Slow.** Requires typing FLO ID and finding record. | **N/A.** |
| **Hardware** | **Universal.** Any smartphone camera. | **Technical.** Requires laptop/dedicated search. | **Visual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Supermarket Aisle" reality. Consumers decide to buy ethical products in seconds. They won't navigate a complex B2B database like FLOCERT. Live Verify turns the **Product Package** into a live, trusted bridge to the farmer's reality, making ethical shopping a "Verified Fact."
