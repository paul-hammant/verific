## What is a CAT Batch Report?

When a massive disaster (a **Catastrophe** or "CAT") like Hurricane Katrina or a California Wildfire happens, insurance companies pay out thousands of claims at once.

To get their money back from **Reinsurance** companies (the "insurers for insurers"), the primary company sends a **Batch Report**. This is a list of all claims totaling millions of dollars.

If a carrier "sneaks" a normal kitchen fire into a "Hurricane" batch, they are committing reinsurance fraud. Verified hashes allow the reinsurer to audit these multimillion-dollar lists instantly against the carrier's core database.

## Data Verified

Catastrophe code (PCS/ISO), regional boundaries (Zip/County), batch ID, claim count, total paid losses, total reserves, incident date range, carrier ID, audit timestamp.

**Document Types:**
- **CAT Loss Summary:** High-level totals for management/regulators.
- **Bordereau Report:** Detailed claim-by-claim list for reinsurers.
- **Quota Share Statement:** For shared risk partitions.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Insurance Carrier) and the report standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Final/Audited** — Data matches the carrier's core ledger.
- **Estimated** — Initial assessment; subject to change.
- **Superseded** — Updated by a more recent batch report (e.g., as reserves develop).
- **Void** — Report retracted due to data error.

## Second-Party Use

The **Carrier Management** benefits from verification.

**Reinsurance Recovery:** Proving to a reinsurer (e.g., Munich Re or Swiss Re) that the $22M loss claim is authentic and matches the carrier's verified CAT data. This accelerates the "Cash Call" process where reinsurers reimburse the carrier.

**Internal Audit:** Ensuring that regional offices aren't "padding" CAT batches with non-CAT claims (attritional losses) to get higher reinsurance payouts or special disaster funding.

## Third-Party Use

**Reinsurers**
**Claims Verification:** Reinsurers often take weeks to audit "Bordereau" files manually. Live Verify allows them to instantly verify the high-level totals against the carrier's domain, reducing the audit friction.

**State Insurance Commissioners**
**Market Stability:** Regulators can verify the "CAT Exposure" claims made by insurers in their state to ensure the companies remain solvent and have adequate reserves post-disaster.

**Rating Agencies (A.M. Best)**
**Capital Adequacy:** Verifying the actual loss development of a major event to update the carrier's financial strength rating.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Claim Laundering" Fraud Problem**

- **Inclusion of Attritional Loss:** Sneaking a "normal" kitchen fire claim into a "Hurricane" batch to get it covered by a reinsurance treaty that only triggers for CAT events.
- **Amount Inflation:** Editing the "Total Paid" amount on a PDF report to claim more money from a reinsurer than was actually paid to policyholders.
- **Date Stretching:** Moving the date of a loss that happened *after* the storm into the "CAT Window" to get special handling.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Primary Insurers:** (State Farm, Allstate, Liberty Mutual).
**Forensic Audit Firms:** (Providing 3rd party verification).
**Industry Data Bodies:** (ISO / Property Claim Services - PCS).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Crawford & Company issues batch claims reports for catastrophic events and disasters.

```
✓ cat-claims.crawco.co.uk/verify — Issues batch claims reports for catastrophic events
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the report it recorded.


## Competition vs. Blockchain (RiskStream)

| Feature | Live Verify | RiskStream / Corda | Scanned PDF Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interoperability** | **Universal.** Any reinsurer can verify. | **Siloed.** Both parties must be on the specific blockchain. | **Manual.** |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Carrier. | **Consensus-Bound.** Trust the network. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Cost** | **Low.** Standard web infra. | **High.** Requires heavy enterprise blockchain nodes. | **None.** |
| **Privacy** | **High.** Only the specific batch is shared. | **Medium.** Shared ledger metadata. | **Vulnerable.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Legacy Bridge." The insurance industry is moving toward blockchain (RiskStream), but 90% of the world still operates on PDF reports sent via email. Live Verify provides **ledger-level integrity** for the existing PDF-based workflow, allowing carriers to modernize without replacing their entire tech stack.
