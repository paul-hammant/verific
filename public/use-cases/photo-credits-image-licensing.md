## What is an Image License?

In the media and advertising industries, a **Photo License** is the legal contract that authorizes a company to use a specific image. It defines the "Scope of Use"—whether the photo can be used on a billboard, a magazine cover, or just a social media post—and for how long (e.g., 1 year vs. perpetual).

These documents are the "Proof of Permission." Fraud is rampant in the "Copyright Trolling" and "Stock Photo" sectors. Dishonest sites often use stolen images and then create a fake "License PDF" to trick the creator's lawyers into stopping a lawsuit. Similarly, a publisher might "edit" a 1-year license to read "Perpetual" to avoid paying a renewal fee. Verified hashes bind the **Image ID, Licensee Name, and Rights Tier** to the agency's or the photographer's domain (e.g., `gettyimages.com` or `shutterstock.com`).

## Data Verified

License number, image ID (Asset ID), licensee name, photographer name, agency name, usage type (Commercial/Editorial/Personal), geographic scope (Regional/Worldwide), duration (start/end dates), resolution limit, exclusivity status, total license fee paid.

**Document Types:**
- **License Certificate:** The formal proof of purchase.
- **Photo Credit Line:** The specific text that must appear near the photo.
- **Model Release:** (Linked hash) proving the person in the photo consented.
- **DMV Notice of Revocation:** (For agencies) proof a license was voided for non-payment.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`gettyimages.com`, `shutterstock.com`, `reuters.com`) and the license standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Verified** — License is current and payment is cleared.
- **Expired** — **ALERT:** Usage period has lapsed; image must be removed.
- **Restricted** — **ALERT:** Usage is limited (e.g., "Web Only - No Print").
- **Revoked** — **CRITICAL:** License cancelled (e.g., due to breach of terms).

## Second-Party Use

The **Photographer / Artist** benefits from verification.

**Royalty Protection:** A photographer can scan the "Verified" hash of a license sold through an agency. "Verified by Getty" ensure the creator that the agency isn't "Skimming" by reporting a lower-tier license than what the customer actually paid for.

**Portfolio Integrity:** When showing their work to a new client, the photographer can provide verified "License Hashes" to prove that their photos were actually used by high-end brands like *Vogue* or *Nike*, and aren't just "mock-ups."

## Third-Party Use

**Publishers / Web Editors**
**Legal Safe Harbor:** Before publishing a user-submitted photo, the editor scans the provided license. If the hash returns **"VERIFIED - COMMERCIAL,"** they can publish with confidence, protecting the company from "Copyright Troll" lawsuits that can cost $30,000 per image.

**Social Security / Platform Moderators**
**Automatic Filtering:** Platforms like Instagram or YouTube can automatically scan verified hashes in image metadata. If an image is flagged **"REVOKED,"** the system can instantly block its use across the entire network.

**AI Training Models**
**Provenance Vetting:** AI companies (e.g., OpenAI, Adobe) can use verified hashes to prove that the "Training Data" they used was legally licensed from the original creators, avoiding massive class-action copyright lawsuits.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Copyright Laundering" Fraud Problem**

- **Scope Inflation:** Editing a "$50 Web License" to look like a "$5,000 Print Cover License" on a PDF.
- **Agency Spoofing:** Creating a fake "License Letter" from a non-existent agency to hide the use of a stolen image.
- **Model Release Forgery:** Creating a fake "Consent Form" for a person in a photo who never actually signed one.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Global Photo Agencies.**
**Independent Photographer Portals.**
**Copyright Registries (e.g., USPTO / WIPO).**

**Privacy Salt:** Low to Medium. While licenses are commercial contracts, specific pricing and client lists are sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent "Customer List Scraping" by competitors.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Photo agencies and copyright holders issue image licenses certifying usage rights. The issuer is self-authorized as the copyright holder or authorized licensing agent.

```
✓ license.gettyimages.co.uk/verify — Issues verified image licenses with usage scope and duration
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Rationale

Image licensing is the "Currency of the Visual Web." By turning certificates into verifiable digital bridges, we protect the livelihoods of creators and the legal standing of publishers, ensuring that "Permission to Post" is backed by cryptographic proof.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the photo agency's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (license number, image ID, territory, duration, issue date) — never pricing, licensee identity, or photographer payment terms — providing non-repudiation of the license and an audit trail rights holders can inspect.
