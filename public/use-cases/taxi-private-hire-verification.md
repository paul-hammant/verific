## What is Taxi & Private Hire Driver Verification?

A woman leaves a bar alone at midnight. A car pulls up claiming to be her pre-booked minicab. The driver shows a badge: "Mohammed A 8834, PCO Licence PCO-992288, Addison Lee." But how does she know it's real? The badge could be forged. The car might not be registered with any operator. TfL and police run regular campaigns warning about unlicensed drivers who prey on vulnerable passengers.

Live Verify allows her to scan the driver's badge and instantly see:
- **Driver verified as licensed** with Transport for London (TfL) or local authority
- **Vehicle details** match (registration plate, make, model, colour)
- **Operator affiliation** confirmed (Addison Lee, Uber, Bolt, etc.)
- **Active status** — not suspended, revoked, or expired
- **Authority chain** to `tfl.gov.uk → gov.uk`, proving it's not a forgery

This happens in 10 seconds—the critical window between the car arriving and the passenger getting in. She can then share the verified driver details with an emergency contact before entering the vehicle.

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the passenger's perspective. The vehicle arrives and the driver claims to be the booked car.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The driver controls the vehicle and the route — once inside, the passenger's options are limited, especially late at night or in an unfamiliar area.

**Verification asymmetry:** The passenger is being asked to get into the car immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the driver is currently licensed, the vehicle is registered to an operator, and the person matches the booking.

**Why would you bother checking?** Because you are about to get into a stranger's car, alone, often late at night. Once inside, your options are limited. The specific consequences of getting into an unlicensed vehicle are well-documented: sexual assault, robbery, unlicensed and uninsured driving (meaning no liability cover if there is an accident), and — in extreme cases — kidnapping. The driver swap is a known pattern: a licensed driver passes the background check but routinely subcontracts evening shifts to an unlicensed friend or family member. The verification response includes a `photo_url` field — the badge verifies as "LICENSED" but the face behind the wheel doesn't match the photo on record, and the substitution is caught before the passenger gets in.

**Verification by Visual Inspection:**
When presented with a physical driver badge, a passenger must rely on visual inspection to authenticate it. This requires recognizing the issuing authority's logo, security features, and layout—all of which are difficult without specialist knowledge and easily forged. A static card provides no real-time confirmation that the driver is actually licensed today.

*The server rotates the salt — after each successful scan (burn-on-verify) or on TTL expiry of an unscanned salt — and the badge re-renders to match. The screen is always in lockstep with the salt the server will honour, so a photograph is worthless unless verified in the moment. See [E-Ink ID Cards](../e-ink-id-cards.md) for how this prevents cloning and protects driver privacy.*

## Data Verified

Driver name (partial for privacy), photo (hash), PCO licence number, vehicle details (make/model/colour/registration plate), operator affiliation, licence expiry date, DBS check date, current active status.

**Document Types:**
- **Driver Badge (Physical Card):** Worn by the driver, displayed during initial contact.
- **Driver Badge (E-Ink Display):** Next-generation rotating-salt badge on the driver's lanyard.
- **Mobile App Display:** Backup credential shown on the driver's phone.
- **Operator Platform Verification:** In-app proof from Uber, Bolt, or other platforms (where available).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`drivers.tfl.gov.uk`, local authority licensing boards) and current driver status.

**Status Indications:**
- **LICENSED** — Driver is active and in good standing; authorized to carry passengers.
- **SUSPENDED** — Licence suspended; driver must not carry passengers; entry should be declined.
- **EXPIRED** — Licence has lapsed; driver is no longer authorized.
- **REVOKED** — Licence permanently revoked (e.g., due to serious violations); entry should be declined.
- **404 NOT FOUND** — Badge credentials not found in issuer database; possible forgery or theft; entry should be declined.

## The Safety Moment

The 10-second window between a car arriving and a passenger entering is where verification must happen. This is critical for vulnerable passengers—especially women alone at night.

**The Verification Flow:**

1. **Car arrives.** Driver shows badge (physical or phone display).
2. **Scan & Verify.** Passenger scans in 2-3 seconds.
3. **Confirmation.** Green light: "Driver Licensed - Addison Lee - Toyota Prius LG73 XYZ."
4. **Share with Emergency Contact.** App suggests: "Share this driver's details and ETA with your emergency contact?"
5. **Get in safely.** Passenger has cryptographic proof of the driver's legitimacy and a contact trail.

**If Verification Fails:**
- **404 or Revoked status:** Do not enter the vehicle. Call the operator or police.
- **Suspended status:** Driver has serious compliance issues. Decline the ride.
- **Network unavailable:** Fall back to manual visual inspection; ask for government-issued ID (passport/driving licence) and cross-check photo.

## Second-Party Use

The **Taxi / Private Hire Driver** (second party) receives the PCO licence and ID badge from the licensing authority (first party), **keeps it**, and displays it to third parties as part of normal passenger interaction.

**Personal Record:** Drivers have their own verified credential proving their licensed status. The badge sits on their lanyard during every shift—the verification value is always at hand.

**Peace of Mind:** Drivers can confirm at any time that their licence is active and properly registered with TfL or the local authority. A driver is not complicit in false claims about their status.

**Professional Reputation:** Drivers benefit from passenger confidence. A nervous passenger who scans and sees "LICENSED - Addison Lee" is much more likely to accept the ride than one relying on a static badge. This speeds up the "is this my cab?" moment and reduces friction.

**Dispute Resolution:** If a passenger later claims the driver was unlicensed or unsafe, the driver has cryptographic proof of their licensed status at the time of the trip—supporting defense against false allegations.

## Third-Party Use

The taxi driver (second party) presents the verified credential to various third parties:

**Passengers (Especially Women Alone at Night)**
**Personal Safety:** Before getting into a car with a stranger, a passenger can scan the driver's badge to confirm:
- The person is a verified, licensed driver
- The car's registration plate and details match
- The driver's licence is in good standing
- Real-time status from the official regulator (TfL or local authority)

This is the primary use case. A woman alone late at night can make an informed safety decision in seconds. She can also share the driver's details with an emergency contact.

**Airport / Train Station Dispatchers**
**Queue Verification:** Dispatchers managing rank queues can instantly verify that drivers waiting in the queue are currently licensed, preventing unlicensed drivers from operating at high-value transport hubs.

**Corporate Travel Managers**
**Executive Transport Vetting:** Corporate travel departments can verify that drivers pre-approved for executive transport are currently licensed before assigning them a trip.

**Police at Roadside Checks**
**Enforcement:** Police performing traffic enforcement or routine stops can verify that drivers are properly licensed as private hire operators, catching unlicensed drivers who prey on vulnerable passengers.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Unlicensed Driver" Fraud Problem**

The Sarah Everard case (2021) heightened awareness of predatory unlicensed drivers. TfL statistics show hundreds of unlicensed operators active in London at any time. Victims are often women alone, late at night, in unfamiliar areas.

**Fraud Schemes:**
- **Unlicensed drivers posing as private hire:** Criminals without background checks or regulatory oversight, targeting vulnerable passengers.
- **Cloned plates and badges:** Criminals using vehicle registration plates and PCO badges cloned from legitimate drivers, creating confusion about who is actually licensed.
- **Expired / suspended drivers continuing to work:** Drivers whose licences have lapsed or been revoked due to conduct issues continue operating unlicensed.
- **Account sharing on ride-hail platforms:** A driver passes a background check; an unvetted family member uses their account to drive, avoiding DBS screening.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- **TfL (London):** Issues private hire driver licences and PCO (Private Hire Operator) licenses.
- **Local Authority Licensing (Rest of UK):** County councils and district councils issue driver and operator licences.
- **Ride-Hail Platforms (Secondary):** Uber, Bolt, Addison Lee, and other operators may issue subsidiary verification credentials.
- **International TNC Regulators:** State-level regulators in the US, Australia, and other jurisdictions.

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Private hire drivers work in high-risk environments, often alone with strangers. Badge information is visible to 10-20 passengers per day, plus doorbell cameras, CCTV, and pedestrians. More critically, salt prevents "Stalking" attacks where someone could enumerate driver badges and correlate them with GPS data to track individuals across shifts—creating serious safety risks. Salt also prevents "Competitor Reconnaissance" where rival platforms could map out a company's driver deployment and earnings patterns.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the licensing authority's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (licence numbers, vehicle details, operator affiliations, DBS check dates, expiry dates) — never plaintext (driver full names, home addresses, passenger trip data, GPS routes) — providing non-repudiation of the driver licence and an audit trail regulators can inspect for fraud and safety incidents.
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Taxi and private hire licensing is a statutory function. TfL in London and local authorities elsewhere are the authoritative issuers. Ride-hail platforms operate under these frameworks.

**UK:**

```
✓ drivers.tfl.gov.uk/verify — Issues private hire driver credentials and licence verification for London
  ✓ tfl.gov.uk — Regulates London transport services (statutory authority)
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

**Local Authorities (England outside London):**

```
✓ taxi-licensing.council.gov.uk/verify — Issues driver licence verification (council-level)
  ✓ council.gov.uk — Local authority (statutory licensing power)
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Text-to-Hash Suitability

**Primary scenario: Physical OCR, not text-to-hash.**

This use case is fundamentally **in-vehicle-based**. The verification happens in person: a passenger looks at the driver's badge in the car before departure, scanning it in seconds. The badge is physical (lanyard, card, e-ink display), and the verification happens via camera/OCR in real time.

**Text-to-hash applicability is limited to:**
- **Incident reporting / HR disputes:** A passenger reports an unsafe driver; the recipient (operator, TfL) selects the badge details from a passenger's photo or video recording and verifies the driver's status at the time of the trip.
- **After-incident investigation:** Police reviewing CCTV or dashcam footage that captured the badge and verifying the driver's licence status.
- **Operator compliance audits:** Operators archiving digital copies of driver badge verifications for regulatory files.

**Why this matters:** The primary value is real-time in-vehicle authentication. Text-to-hash is a secondary use case for after-the-fact verification and dispute resolution.

## Rationale

Passenger safety is the primary driver, especially for vulnerable passengers—women alone at night, elderly passengers, those in unfamiliar areas. Domain binding verifies the regulator (tfl.gov.uk, local authority domains). It bridges the gap between the physical presence of a driver and the digital record of their regulatory status, enabling real-time safety decisions and enhancing trust while preventing unlicensed operators from preying on vulnerable passengers.

## Related Derivations

**Pedicab / Rickshaw Driver Verification**

In tourist areas (London, Edinburgh, Barcelona, etc.), pedicabs and rickshaws operate in semi-regulated markets. The same verification pattern applies:

- **Driver badge** with name, ID number, vehicle ID
- **Operator affiliation** (e.g., "London Pedicabs Ltd")
- **Insurance proof** (key liability requirement for tourist transport)
- **Route authorization** (some areas restrict operators to specific zones)

Tourists, especially those travelling alone, can verify a pedicab driver before boarding, reducing exposure to unlicensed operators or uninsured vehicles.

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, the response includes a verification ID that serves both passenger safety and driver accountability:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: LICENSED

--- For Your Records ---
You verified an active private hire driver.
Driver: Mohammed A 8834 (PCO-992288)
Vehicle: Toyota Prius LG73 XYZ
Operator: Addison Lee
Verification ID: VRF-2026-03-10-22:47:13-5q1k8m3p
Licence Expiry: 2028-06-30
DBS Check Date: 2024-02-15

If you have safety concerns about this journey:
https://tfl.gov.uk/report-driver?ref=VRF-2026-03-10-22:47:13-5q1k8m3p

Recommended action: Share this verification with an emergency contact
```

**What This Enables:**

**For Passengers:**
- **One-click report path** — Verification ID pre-filled; no need to remember badge numbers
- **Timestamp proof** — Proves verification happened at the time of the trip
- **Context preserved** — TfL can look up which driver's licence was active at that moment
- **Emergency contact integration** — App automatically shares driver details and journey ETA

**For Drivers:**
- **Reputation proof** — Drivers can point to verification logs showing they were verified and licensed; disputes about their licence status are easily resolved
- **Dispute defense** — If a passenger falsely claims the driver was unlicensed or unsafe, the driver has cryptographic proof of their licensed status

**For TfL / Local Authorities:**
- **Fraud detection** — Identification of unlicensed operators (404 responses, revoked licences still being used)
- **Safety audit trail** — Verification data supports investigations into assault or harassment claims
- **Operator accountability** — Licensing enforcement can track which operators have verified drivers and which have problematic staff
