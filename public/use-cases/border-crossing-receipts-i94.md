## Data Verified

Admission (I-94) Record Number, full name, date of birth, passport number, country of issuance, class of admission (e.g., B-1, F-1, H-1B), date of entry, "Admit Until" date.

**Document Types:**
- **Electronic I-94 Printout:** The standard proof of legal entry.
- **Paper I-94 (White/Green):** Issued at land borders or in rare cases.
- **I-94A:** For certain classes of admission.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`cbp.gov`) and current admission status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Valid** — Traveler is currently in legal status.
- **Overstay** — "Admit Until" date has passed without extension.
- **Departed** — Traveler has left the U.S. (record closed).
- **Adjusted** — Status has changed (e.g., to Permanent Resident).

## Second-Party Use

The **Traveler** (Non-citizen) benefits from verification.

**Employment (I-9):** The authoritative answer should still come from the official employer-authorization workflow where one exists. Live Verify is more credible when the employer is holding only a copied I-94 printout and needs a bridge back to current government status.

**Driver's License:** DMVs require proof of legal presence. A document-to-status bridge may help when staff are working from the printout, but SAVE or other direct government checks should remain primary.

**SSN Application:** Proving legal status to the Social Security Administration for number issuance.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers (HR Departments)**
**Compliance:** Ensuring they don't hire someone with an expired or fake I-94, which avoids massive federal fines. The strongest production path is still the official employer-authorization workflow; Live Verify is only the portability layer when the copied printout is what is actually circulating.

**Universities (DSOs)**
**Student Monitoring:** International Student Offices (DSOs) verify the I-94s of thousands of students every semester to maintain SEVIS compliance.

**Banks / Mortgage Lenders**
**Legal Presence:** Verifying that a borrower is legally present in the U.S. for the duration of a loan or to comply with KYC/AML regulations.

## Verification Architecture

**The "I-94 Alteration" Fraud Problem**

- **Date Extension:** Changing the "Admit Until" date from 2024 to 2026 in a PDF editor to hide an overstay.
- **Class Swapping:** Changing a "B-2" (Tourist - No Work) to an "H-1B" (Work Authorized) to get a job.
- **Record Fabrication:** Creating a fake I-94 number for a person who entered the country illegally.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):** The primary issuer.
**DHS SAVE System:** (The backend database).

**Privacy Salt:** Essential. I-94 numbers and names are highly sensitive. The hash must be salted to prevent status enumeration.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

Records US border entry admissions and permits.

```
✓ i94.cbp.dhs.gov/verify — Records US border entry admissions and permits
  ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the issuer, and any subsequent changes to the payload as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change, or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (key identifiers and dates)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext or sensitive personal information
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to document holders/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Issuer cannot deny issuing the document
- **Timestamp proof:** Document existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** Jurisdictions can inspect the witness ledger for fraud detection
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if issuer's systems go down

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Issuer domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion


## Competition vs. DHS SAVE System

| Feature | Live Verify | DHS SAVE System | Paper Printout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accessibility** | **Helpful when only the printout is in hand.** | **Primary for formal government/legal-presence checks.** | **Manual.** |
| **Speed** | **Fast bridge from the printout.** | **Can be slow.** Often takes days for manual verification. | **Instant.** |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to `cbp.gov`. | **High.** Direct DB access. | **Low.** Easily faked. |
| **Integration** | **Lightweight.** | **Heavy.** Requires complex API integration and federal vetting. | **None.** |

**Narrower conclusion:** This is not a replacement for SAVE, CBP systems, or formal immigration-status adjudication. It is only defensible as a lighter bridge for relying parties who are already working from an emailed or printed I-94 outside those systems.
