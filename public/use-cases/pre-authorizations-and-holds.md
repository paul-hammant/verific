## What is a Pre-Authorization or Hold?

Most approvals are open-ended: once granted, they stand until rescinded. A **pre-authorization** is different — it is *conditional, time-boxed, and often single-use*. It says: *this is approved in advance, up to this limit, for this purpose, until this moment.* A health insurer pre-authorizes a procedure. A card network places a pre-auth hold for a hotel or fuel purchase. A retailer approves a return (RMA) before goods are sent back. A lender pre-approves a borrower up to a ceiling. A travel authorization clears entry for a window.

This is the **"other dynamic"** of approvals — the one whose defining features are *expiry* and *consumption*. A pre-authorization is meant to be used once (or within a window) and then to stop being valid. That makes it a natural fit for Live Verify's re-salting mechanisms: [burn-on-verify](../../docs/Technical_Concepts.md#burn-on-verify) (the salt is consumed the moment it's verified) for single-use approvals that should not be replayable, and [owner-issued expiring links](../../docs/Technical_Concepts.md#owner-issued-expiring-links) for holder-controlled, time-limited validity.

The fraud surface is precisely the time-and-use dimension: a pre-authorization that was already used, has expired, or never existed, presented as live to obtain treatment, goods, money, or a refund.

## The Approval Types

The conditional/time-boxed pattern recurs across sectors:

- **Medical / insurance prior authorization** — A health plan approves a procedure, drug, or referral in advance, for a window and a unit count. Providers and patients rely on it.
- **Payment pre-authorization hold** — A card network or bank reserves funds (hotel, car rental, fuel) that expire if not captured. Merchants and cardholders rely on it.
- **Return / RMA approval** — A retailer or manufacturer approves a specific return before goods ship back, valid for a window. Warehouses and carriers rely on it.
- **Lending pre-approval** — A lender pre-approves a borrower up to a ceiling, valid for a period subject to conditions. Sellers and brokers rely on it.
- **Travel / entry authorization** — An advance clearance valid for a window (the standing version is covered by [ESTA Travel Authorizations](view.html?doc=esta-travel-authorization); here the focus is the time-boxed, consume-on-use dynamic).

Each shares the structure: approved in advance, capped, time-limited, and frequently single-use.

## The Approval Fraud Problem

- **Replay** — A genuine, already-used authorization is presented again to obtain a second service, capture, or refund. **Burn-on-verify** defeats this: the link is consumed on first successful verification and re-salts, so a replayed copy fails.
- **Expired-as-live** — An authorization whose window has closed is presented as current. The endpoint returns EXPIRED rather than verifying.
- **Limit / scope inflation** — A pre-auth for one MRI or a £400 hold is edited to cover more units or a higher amount. Binding units and limits into the hash breaks the tampered copy.
- **Phantom authorization** — A fabricated "approved" letter or hold confirmation with no real record behind it.
- **Eligibility drift** — A real authorization where the underlying eligibility (insurance coverage, account funding) has since lapsed; the status reflects this.

## Data Verified

Issuer, authorization number, the approved service/purpose, the approved limit (amount and/or units), the validity window, single-use vs. multi-use, the provider/merchant it applies to, and the date approved. Personal data is minimized — the member/cardholder may appear as "on file" with a salt (see Privacy Salt).

## Privacy Salt

Pre-authorizations frequently concern sensitive matters (a named person's medical procedure, a cardholder's spending). Where the verifiable text would otherwise let an interceptor enumerate or reconstruct sensitive facts, the issuer salts the record and minimizes plaintext (e.g., "[name on file]"). For single-use authorizations, **burn-on-verify** additionally rotates the salt on each successful verification, so an intercepted link cannot be replayed or used to probe.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (e.g., `meridianhealth.com`) and the current status of the authorization.

**Verification Response Format:**

```json
{
  "status": "verified",
  "allowedDomains": ["springfieldimaging.com", "*.springfieldimaging.com"]
}
```

**Status Indications:**
- **Approved — valid** — Within the window, not yet consumed; safe to act on.
- **Pending capture / not yet used** — A hold is in place but not finalized.
- **Consumed / captured** — The single-use authorization has already been used; further use is invalid (burn-on-verify returns this on replay).
- **Expired** — The validity window has closed.
- **Revoked** — Withdrawn before use (eligibility lapse, fraud flag, cancellation).
- **404** — No such authorization exists (never issued, forged, or OCR error).

## Second-Party Use

The **holder** (patient, cardholder, borrower, returning customer) benefits.

**Proof at the point of service:** A patient arriving for a procedure can show the provider a verifiable, in-window authorization rather than a screenshot the front desk must phone to confirm. A pre-approved borrower can prove their ceiling to a seller on the spot.

**Holder-controlled exposure (owner-issued expiring links):** For high-value or sensitive pre-approvals, the holder can use a timed, holder-initiated link so the authorization is only verifiable when they choose, and only for a short window — preventing standing exposure of a sensitive approval.

## Third-Party Use

**Providers and Merchants**

**Service / capture decision:** A provider verifies the prior authorization is genuine, in-window, and not already consumed before delivering a service that may not otherwise be paid for. A merchant confirms a hold before releasing goods.

**Warehouses and Carriers**

**Return intake:** A warehouse confirms an RMA approval is valid and unconsumed before accepting returned goods — blunting "return without authorization" and double-return fraud.

**Payment Operations and Claims**

**Replay defence:** Finance and claims teams reject already-consumed or expired authorizations automatically, because the verification status — not a human reading a date — is authoritative.

**Sellers and Brokers**

**Pre-approval reliance:** A seller accepting an offer "subject to pre-approval" verifies the lender's pre-approval is real, current, and within its ceiling.

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Pre-authorizations are meant to expire and to be used once, but a static PDF or screenshot does neither
- Already-used or expired authorizations are replayed to obtain duplicate services, captures, or refunds
- Limits and units are edited to inflate what was approved
- Sensitive pre-auths (medical, financial) risk exposure if left as standing, enumerable links

**The Fix:** The issuer publishes a verifiable authorization record at its domain with an explicit window and single-use flag. **Burn-on-verify** consumes and re-salts single-use authorizations on first verification; **owner-issued expiring links** give holders timed, on-demand validity for sensitive cases. The relying party's decision is driven by the live status, not by reading a printed date.

**The reliance flow:**
1. The issuer approves a request in advance, with a limit and window
2. It publishes a verifiable authorization record (hash), single-use or time-boxed
3. The provider/merchant clips the authorization at the point of service
4. Verification returns valid / consumed / expired — and consumes the link if single-use
5. A replayed or expired authorization fails; the relying party declines or escalates

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial / Regulated (sector-dependent)

The issuer is the approving party — an insurer, card network, lender, or retailer — operating under its sector's rules.

```
✓ meridianhealth.com/auth/v — Prior authorization records
  ✓ meridianhealth.com — Health plan (issuer)
```

For payment holds the chain runs through the issuing bank and card network; for lending pre-approvals, through the regulated lender.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (authorization number, approved service/limit, validity window, provider it applies to, approval date) — never member/cardholder identifying information — providing non-repudiation of pre-authorization issuance and consumption/expiry events.

## Further Derivations

1. **Single-use medical prior authorizations (burn-on-verify)** — Procedure/drug authorizations consumed on first verification at the point of service, so they cannot be replayed for a second claim.
2. **Payment pre-auth hold confirmations** — Time-boxed hold records that merchants verify before capture and that expire automatically with the hold.
3. **RMA / return-authorization verification** — Single-use return approvals that warehouses verify on intake, defeating unauthorized and double returns.
