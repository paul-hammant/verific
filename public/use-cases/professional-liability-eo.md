## What is E&O Insurance?

**Errors and Omissions (E&O)** insurance, also known as Professional Liability, protects professionals (lawyers, architects, engineers, doctors) if a client sues them for a mistake in their work or advice.

It is the "Insurance for Brainwork." If an architect's design causes a balcony to collapse, or a lawyer misses a filing deadline, E&O pays the massive legal and settlement costs.

**"Retroactive Date Fraud"** is a critical risk in this sector. E&O policies are usually "Claims-Made," meaning they only cover work done after a specific **Retroactive Date**. A professional who missed a design error 5 years ago might "edit" their certificate's retroactive date from 2024 to 2015 to hide that they weren't actually insured at the time of the error. Verified hashes bind the **Policy Limits and the Retroactive Date** to the underwriter's domain.

## Data Verified

Named Insured (Firm/Professional), Policy Number, Coverage Limits (Per-Claim/Aggregate), Deductible Amount, Retroactive Date (Archival work start), Extended Reporting Period (Tail), Issuing Carrier (NAIC code), Professional Discipline (e.g., "Lawyer" vs "Architect").

**Document Types:**
- **Certificate of Insurance (COI):** The standard "Proof of Insurance" page.
- **Tail Coverage Policy:** Insuring work after a professional retires.
- **Binder of Insurance:** Temporary proof before the full policy is issued.
- **Declarations Page:** The "Face Page" of the long-form contract.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`hiscox.com`, `travelers.com`, `aig.com`) and policy standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active/In-Force** — Policy is paid and verified.
- **Cancelled** — **ALERT:** Professional no longer has malpractice coverage.
- **Limit Eroded** — **ALERT:** Prior claims have significantly reduced the remaining coverage.
- **Tail Only** — Coverage only for past work; current work is uninsured.

## Second-Party Use

The **Professional Firm** (second party) receives the E&O certificate from the insurance carrier (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of their coverage limits and retroactive date. Most of the time, the document sits in their business files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the certificate matches what the carrier's system recorded and hasn't been altered.

**Future Optionality:** If a claim arises or a contract is disputed, they have cryptographic proof of their coverage ready without needing to contact the broker or carrier.

## Third-Party Use

The professional firm (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Corporate Procurement Officers**
**Vendor Vetting:** Before engaging an IT consultant or an accountant, the company scans their COI. "Verified by Hiscox.com" ensure the consultant hasn't "Photoshopped" a $100k policy into a $5M one to meet the contract requirements.

**Real Estate Developers**
**Liability Shield:** Ensuring that every architect and structural engineer on a $100M project has a verified, non-cancelled E&O policy, protecting the developer from un-insured design defect claims.

**Lenders and Investors**
**Due Diligence:** Verifying the "Malpractice Safety Net" of a target firm during a merger or acquisition (M&A) deal.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Claims-Made" Fraud Problem**

- **Retroactive Date Tampering:** Changing a 2024 date to 2015 to "back-date" coverage for a known design error.
- **Policy Padding:** Editing a $1M policy to read $10M to meet a client's "Master Service Agreement" requirement.
- **Cancellation Hiding:** Keeping a paper certificate on file after the professional stopped paying the premium 6 months ago.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Specialty Carriers (Hiscox, Beazley, Chubb, Lloyd's)
- Professional MGAs
- Risk Management Platforms (e.g., TrustLayer, CertFocus - hosting verified hashes)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Unlike documents with many unpredictable variables, E&O certificates often contain enumerable values—standard coverage limits ($1M, $2M, $5M per claim), common aggregate limits, round deductibles ($10k, $25k, $50k), and predictable retroactive dates (often January 1st of common years). A competitor could feasibly enumerate combinations to reverse-engineer a firm's insurance profile and client risk exposure. Salt protects this competitive intelligence.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Hiscox issues professional liability and E&O insurance and is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance framework and professional body requirements.

```
✓ eo.hiscox.co.uk/verify — Professional liability and errors and omissions insurer
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (policy number, coverage limits, retroactive date, professional category, policy period) — never firm names, specific claim details, or premium amounts — providing non-repudiation of the coverage terms and retroactive date.

## Competition vs. ACORD 25 Forms

| Feature | Live Verify | Standard ACORD 25 (PDF) | Broker Portal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Claims-Made" Reality. In professional services, the *integrity of the dates* is more important than the paper itself. Live Verify turns the **Static Certificate** into a live link to the carrier's ledger, ensuring that the "Professional Safety Net" is a cryptographically verified and active fact.
