## What is Terrorism (TRIPRA) Insurance?

In the commercial real estate and infrastructure sectors, **Terrorism Insurance** is a mandatory requirement for large loans and high-profile leases. Under the US **Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA)**, the federal government acts as a backstop for insurers after a "Certified Act of Terrorism."

These documents are the "Proof of Backstop." Fraud is common in "High-Risk Urban Zones": a developer might create a fake insurance binder showing $100M in terrorism coverage to satisfy a lender's requirement for a skyscraper, when they actually only have standard property coverage. Similarly, they might "edit" a policy to remove a "Non-Certified Act" exclusion. Verified hashes bind the **Coverage Limits, Tripra Premium, and Property Location** to the carrier's domain (e.g., `zurich.com` or `lloyds.com`).

## Data Verified

Policy number, insurer name, insured entity name, property address, TRIPRA certified act limit, non-certified act limit (if any), premium attributable to terrorism, policy effective/expiration dates, deductible structure, exclusions (e.g., Cyber-Terrorism), broker ID.

**Document Types:**
- **TRIPRA Disclosure Form:** The federally mandated notice.
- **Terrorism Policy Schedule:** The specific coverage limits.
- **Evidence of Property Insurance:** Provided to mortgage lenders.
- **Terrorism Risk Assessment:** (Linked hash) the underwriting analysis.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`zurich.com`, `chubb.com`, `lloyds.com`) and the coverage standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **Active / Bound** — Policy is current and the property is protected.
- **Lapsed** — **CRITICAL:** Terrorism premium was not paid; coverage is void.
- **Certified Act Active** — **ALERT:** The US Treasury has declared an act of terrorism; claims window open.
- **Revoked** — **ALERT:** Policy cancelled (e.g., due to discovery of un-insured high-risk occupancy).

## Second-Party Use

The **Property Owner** (second party) receives the TRIPRA disclosure from the insurance carrier (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** The property owner has their own verified copy of the terrorism coverage terms. Most of the time, the document sits in their insurance files—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** The property owner can confirm at any time that the disclosure matches what the carrier's system recorded and hasn't been altered, ensuring the federally-backed safety net is in place.

**Future Optionality:** If a dispute arises—whether about coverage limits, premium disputes, or claims—the property owner has cryptographic proof ready without needing to contact the carrier.

## Third-Party Use

The property owner (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**Mortgage Lenders (Loan Draw Release)**
Before releasing a construction draw for a high-profile skyscraper, the lender receives the owner's verified terrorism insurance hash. "Verified by Zurich" ensures the lender that the federally-backed safety net is in place, allowing millions in capital to flow without a 48-hour manual document vetting.

**Corporate Tenants (Lease Compliance)**
A Fortune 500 company leasing 10 floors of a building receives the landlord's verified hash to ensure the building meets the "Terrorism Resilience" standards required by their internal risk policy.

**CMBS Investors (Portfolio Audit)**
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security investors automatically monitor the terrorism coverage of 1,000 properties. If a building's hash returns **"LAPSED,"** the system instantly flags the bond for "Increased Risk."

**Re-Insurance Markets (Accumulation Control)**
Large insurers "selling off" terrorism risk to re-insurers provide verified hashes to ensure that the "Property Location" used for risk accumulation modeling is the exact same location recorded in the primary policy.

## Verification Architecture

**The "High-Rise Binder" Fraud Problem**

- **Certified Act Inflation:** Editing a $10M non-certified limit to look like a $100M federal-backed certified limit on a PDF.
- **Exclusion Removal:** Manually deleting a "Nuclear/Biological/Chemical" (NBC) exclusion from a disclosure form.
- **Binder Mimicry:** Using a reputable carrier's letterhead to issue a fake "Terrorism Binder" for an un-insured asset.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- Global Commercial Carriers
- Surplus Lines Insurers (Specialists)
- Lender Compliance Portals (e.g., Insurance Tracking Services)

**Privacy Salt:** Required. Building locations and insurance values are sensitive competitive and security data. While each policy contains unique combinations of property addresses, policy numbers, and specific coverage limits ($150M certified, $25M non-certified) that provide some entropy, the strategic importance of this information—and the risk that terrorists or competitors could use enumeration to identify high-value targets or gain market intelligence—means salt is essential. Salt protects both national security interests and commercial confidentiality.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Insurance carriers issue TRIPRA terrorism coverage and are regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority under the UK insurance and terrorism reinsurance framework.

```
✓ terrorism.poolre.co.uk/verify — Insurance carrier issuing TRIPRA-compliant terrorism policies
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK general insurance firms
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the carrier's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (coverage limits, premiums, policy numbers, effective dates) — never property owner names, addresses, or tenant details — providing non-repudiation of terrorism coverage issuance.

## Rationale

Terrorism insurance is the "Backstop of Urban Finance." By turning specialty disclosures into verifiable digital bridges, we ensure that the multi-billion dollar capital markets are based on the digital truth of the policy, protecting both city skylines and global investors.
