## What is a Cashier's Check?

A **Cashier's Check** is a "Guaranteed Check" written by the bank itself, not by a person. Because the bank takes the money from the sender's account *immediately*, the check is supposedly "as good as cash."

Because people trust them, they are the #1 tool for scammers. Fraudsters create high-quality fake checks to buy cars on Craigslist or to send "overpayments" to victims.

The seller thinks the check is real, hands over the car keys, and then discovers 3 days later that the check was a forgery. Verified hashes allow a seller to scan the check at the curb and see "VERIFIED OUTSTANDING" on the bank's own website *before* handing over the keys.

**Why you should bother verifying:**

- **The 3-day hold is a trap.** Your bank accepts the deposit and may even show provisional credit. Three to five days later, the check bounces. The bank reverses the deposit. The car, the laptop, or the furniture is gone. You are out the item *and* any "change" you gave back if the check was for more than the asking price.
- **The "overpayment" scam relies on this delay.** The buyer sends a cashier's check for $5,000 more than the price, asks you to wire back the difference, and the check is fake. You wire $5,000 of real money before the forgery is discovered.
- **Verification at the point of exchange changes everything.** Scanning the check before handing over the goods takes seconds. A confirmed "OUTSTANDING" status from the issuing bank's domain means the check is real and has not been cashed. A 404 or "NOT FOUND" means the check number does not exist. Either way, you know before you hand over the keys.

## Data Verified

Payee name, dollar amount (numerical and text), check/serial number, issuing bank routing number, date of issuance, purchaser name (remitter), memo/reference details.

**Document Types:**
- **Cashier's Check:** Guaranteed by the bank's own funds.
- **Official Check:** Often used for corporate payments.
- **Money Order:** (Western Union, USPS, MoneyGram).
- **Certified Check:** Personal check with bank-guaranteed funds.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Bank) and current payment status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Outstanding** — Check is valid and has not yet been cashed.
- **Cleared** — Funds have been paid to the payee.
- **Stop Payment** — Payment blocked (e.g., due to loss/theft).
- **Void** — Re-issued or cancelled by the remitter.

## Second-Party Use

The **Remitter** (Purchaser) benefits from verification.

**Anti-Fraud:** Proving to a seller (e.g., a car seller or landlord) that the check is 100% genuine and the funds are "Verified Outstanding" at the bank. This prevents the seller from being victimized by the common "Fake Cashier's Check" scam.

**Loss Recovery:** Instantly verifying the "Stop Payment" status if the check is lost in the mail, allowing for a faster re-issuance process.

## Third-Party Use

**Attorneys / Escrow Agents**
**Real Estate Closings:** Verifying that the multimillion-dollar cashier's check for a house purchase is real *before* signing over the deed. This stops the most high-stakes form of wire/check fraud in the legal industry.

**Used Car Buyers / Sellers**
**Private Sales:** A seller can scan the check at the curb before handing over the keys and title, ensuring the "Bank Guarantee" is real.

**Banks (Deposit Intake)**
**Risk Reduction:** When a customer deposits a large cashier's check from another bank, the receiving bank can verify it instantly via the hash, allowing them to release the funds faster (reducing the standard 3-5 day "hold" period).

## Verification Architecture

**The "Fake Check" Fraud Problem**

- **High-Quality Forgeries:** Scammers using high-end printers to create near-perfect copies of bank checks. The "Check Number" might be real, but the "Amount" or "Payee" is altered.
- **Closed Accounts:** Issuing a check from an account that is about to be closed.
- **Overpayment Scams:** Sending a fake $5,000 check for a $2,000 item and asking for the $3,000 "difference" to be wired back before the bank realizes the check is fake.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Retail Banks:** (Wells Fargo, Chase, BofA).
**Postal Services:** (USPS Money Orders).
**Payment Networks:** (Western Union, MoneyGram).

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Banks are regulated depository institutions that guarantee cashier's checks with their own funds.

```
✓ chase.com/cashiers-check — Issues guaranteed bank checks
  ✓ occ.treas.gov — Regulates US national banks
    ✓ usa.gov/verifiers — US federal government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the issuer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the instrument it issued.


## Competition vs. Positive Pay / Call-In

| Feature | Live Verify | Positive Pay (Corporate) | Calling the Bank |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Access** | **Universal.** Any private seller/landlord. | **Restricted.** Only for big businesses. | **Slow.** Often takes 20+ mins on hold. |
| **Trust** | **Cryptographic.** Bound to the bank domain. | **High.** Direct DB link. | **Human.** Prone to social engineering. |
| **Integrity** | **Binds All Fields.** Payee + Amount + Date. | **High.** | **Vague.** "Yes, check #123 is valid." |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **Fast.** | **Very Slow.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Kitchen Table" transaction. Most cashier's check fraud happens in private transactions where the seller doesn't have access to "Corporate Positive Pay" systems and the bank's fraud department is closed (weekends/evenings). Live Verify provides **24/7, expert-level verification** to anyone with a smartphone.
