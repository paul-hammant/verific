## What is a Calibration Certificate?

A **Calibration Certificate** is proof that a measuring device or tool is accurate. It's the "birth certificate" for a precision tool—proving that a wrench, a pressure gauge, a thermometer, or an analytical balance actually measures what it claims to measure.

**Examples:**
- **Industrial Labs:** In high-tech manufacturing (microchips, vaccines, pharmaceuticals), even a tiny measurement error can ruin a $10 million batch of product.
- **Field Tools:** If a doctor uses an uncalibrated thermometer, they might miss a fever. If a mechanic uses an uncalibrated torque wrench, a wheel might fall off a plane.

**Metrology** is the science of measurement. A **Calibration Certificate** from an accredited lab (ISO 17025 certified) proves that the instrument was tested against a **National Standard** (like NIST or NPL) and is accurate within specified tolerances.

**The Fraud Problem:** Because these certificates are required by law (FDA, ISO, FAA), some shady companies "Dry-Lab" their results—meaning they just write down fake "perfect" numbers without actually testing the instrument. They also forge dates, edit PDFs to extend expiration, or claim NIST traceability when their own reference standards are expired. Verified hashes stop this dangerous fraud.

## Data Verified

Instrument description, make/model/serial number, calibration date, expiration (due) date, as-found/as-left status, measurement data (test points and uncertainty), accreditation status (ISO 17025), reference standard used (NIST/NPL traceability), technician name/credentials, lab accreditation ID, environmental conditions (temperature/humidity), next service date.

**Document Types:**
- **Full Calibration Certificate:** The formal technical proof of accuracy for lab and field instruments.
- **Calibration Sticker:** The small label placed directly on the tool (with OCR hash for field verification).
- **Measurement Data Report:** Detailed table of test points and uncertainty budgets.
- **Service Report:** Including repair, cleaning notes, and adjustments made.
- **Traceability Tree:** Visual map back to national standards (NIST, NPL, PTB).

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (the Accredited Lab) and the certification standing.

**Status Indications:**
- **In-Tolerance / Valid** — Instrument is accurate and safe for use; certificate matches the lab's official record.
- **Out-of-Tolerance** — Instrument failed calibration; measurements made with it are suspect.
- **Expired** — Calibration interval passed; re-calibration is overdue; instrument must be pulled from service.
- **Retracted** — Certificate voided (e.g., due to lab equipment error or discovery of fraudulent testing).
- **Recalled** — Lab discovered an error in its own reference standards; all related certificates under review.
- **Adjusted** — Instrument was modified/repaired during service; original accuracy may not apply.

### Scope enrichment: what the lab is accredited to calibrate, and until when

Calibration is inherently point-in-time (it drifts) and scope-bounded (a lab accredited for one
instrument class may claim broader). A calibration certificate carries no personal data, so on
verification the lab can safely **echo the accreditation scope and the calibration interval** —
`accredited_scope` (the exact instrument classes the lab holds accreditation for),
`calibrated_on`, and `recalibration_due`. This lets the user see that an instrument outside the lab's
accredited scope, or past its recalibration date, is not covered by the certificate even though the
certificate verifies — directly addressing the scope-fraud and stale-calibration cases above. Safe
enrichment: no personal data, revealing scope and freshness the terse claim withheld (see
[safety-certifications](safety-certifications.md) and
[verification-enrichment-hazards.md](../../docs/verification-enrichment-hazards.md)).

## Second-Party Use

The **Tool Owner / Quality Manager** (second party) receives the calibration certificate from the accredited lab (first party), **keeps it**, and may later hand it to third parties for various reasons, or never do so.

**Personal Record:** They have their own verified copy of the calibration results. Most of the time, the document sits in their quality records or the sticker stays on the tool—the verification value is latent, there *if needed*.

**Peace of Mind:** They can confirm at any time that the calibration matches what the lab's system recorded and hasn't been altered or backdated.

**Future Optionality:** If an audit arises—whether ISO compliance, FDA inspection, or customer quality review—they have cryptographic proof of calibration ready without needing to contact the lab.

## Third-Party Use

The tool owner (second party) may hand the verified document to various third parties:

**FDA / FAA / Government Inspectors**
**Safety Assurance:** Verifying the calibration of medical diagnostic gear, aircraft torque wrenches, or equipment used in device manufacturing. A fake certificate can lead to loss of life.

**Prime Aerospace Contractors**
**Supplier Quality:** Prime contractors (Lockheed, Airbus, SpaceX) can systematically verify the calibration hashes of all their sub-contractor suppliers to ensure the entire supply chain is accurate.

**Insurance Loss Control**
**Liability Defense:** If a part fails causing injury/damage, proving that the measurement tools used during manufacturing were verified as accurate at the time of production.

**Legal Expert Witnesses**
**Forensic Accuracy:** In litigation involving faulty measurements (bridge failure, structural collapse, medical malpractice), verifying the calibration of the original engineering/diagnostic tools used is a primary forensic step.

## Verification Architecture

**The Calibration Certificate Fraud Problem**

**Lab-Side Fraud (Dry-Labbing):**
- **Fabricated Measurements:** A technician simply writing "In-Tolerance" numbers without actually running the tests (dry-labbing).
- **Traceability Fraud:** Claiming NIST linkage when the lab's own reference standards are expired or unverified.
- **Scope Fraud:** A lab providing certificates for instruments they aren't accredited to calibrate.

**User-Side Fraud (Pencil Whipping):**
- **Fake Stickers:** Mechanics buying calibration void stickers online and writing in their own dates to bypass company policy.
- **Date Alteration:** Editing a 2024 certificate PDF to read 2026 to avoid the cost of recalibration.
- **Certificate Reuse:** Presenting old calibration certificates as current to pass audits.
- **Fraudulent Copies:** Photocopying or scanning certificates from tools that ARE calibrated to cover tools that ARE NOT.

**Issuer Types (First Party)**

- National Metrology Institutes (NIST USA, NPL UK, PTB Germany)
- Independent Accredited Labs (ISO 17025 certified commercial labs)
- OEM Service Centers (Mettler Toledo, Fluke, Ashcroft, Agilent, Tektronix, Transcat)
- In-House Metrology Labs (Large manufacturers like Ford, Intel, Boeing)

**Privacy Salt:** Not required. Calibration certificates contain many unpredictable variables: unique certificate numbers, instrument serial numbers, specific measurement data points (multiple decimal places), exact calibration dates, technician names, environmental conditions (temperature/humidity to decimal precision), and unique uncertainty values. The combination of these metrological details creates sufficient entropy to prevent hash enumeration attacks.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

```
✓ calibration.npl.co.uk/cert/verify — Calibrates scientific instruments to national standards
  ✓ ukas.com — Accredits UK calibration laboratories
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

Some jurisdictions, contracts, or multi-party workflows may add an independent witness layer. When used, the witnessing firm:

- Receives all hashes from the lab, and any subsequent changes to the certificate as they happen—which may manifest as a new hash, a status change (retracted, recalled), or even a 404 (record deleted)
- Receives structured content/metadata (instrument IDs, measurement results, calibration dates, uncertainty values)
- Does **NOT** receive plaintext (client company names, proprietary measurement techniques)
- Provides an immutable, timestamped audit trail—available to the jurisdiction on demand, to tool owners/third parties during disputes, or as expert witness testimony in legal proceedings

This provides:
- **Non-repudiation:** Lab cannot deny issuing the calibration certificate
- **Timestamp proof:** Certificate hash existed at a specific time
- **Regulatory audit:** ISO accreditation bodies can inspect the witness ledger
- **Resilience:** Verification works even if lab's systems go down or lab loses accreditation

**Public Blockchain (Non-Party)**

If a witness layer exists, it may periodically commit rollups to a public blockchain as an additional timestamping mechanism. That is optional, not inherent to the use case. The verification paths would then be:

1. **Lab domain** — Direct check against the issuer
2. **Witnessing firm** — Independent confirmation with timestamp
3. **Public blockchain** — Decentralized trust anchor via rollup inclusion

## Competition vs. Physical Tamper Seals

| Feature | Live Verify | Lead/Plastic Wire Seal | Sticker (Hologram) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to the Lab. | **Mechanical.** Binds the *box*. | **Visual.** Binds the *surface*. |
| **Data Protection** | **High.** Protects the numbers *inside* the doc. | **Zero.** Doesn't protect data. | **Zero.** |
| **Auditability** | **Digital.** Can be automated. | **Manual.** Requires physical eyes. | **Manual.** |
| **Persistence** | **High.** Archival for 10+ years. | **Fragile.** Cut during maintenance. | **Fragile.** Peeled/Scratched. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** Persistence of Data. A wire seal only proves the device wasn't opened. It doesn't prove the device is *accurate*. Live Verify turns the data *results* into a verifiable artifact, ensuring that the metrologist's actual work remains trustworthy even after the physical seal is broken for the next service cycle.

## Competition vs. Asset Management Software

| Feature | Live Verify | Asset Management SW | Paper / Excel Log |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field Access** | **Instant.** Scan the sticker on the tool. | **Difficult.** Requires laptop/tablet and login to complex ERP. | **Slow.** Find the binder. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds data to the Lab domain. | **Database-Bound.** Can be edited by IT/Admins (audit trail weak). | **Zero.** Easily faked. |
| **Vendor Neutral** | **Yes.** Works across 10 different accredited labs. | **No.** Often requires all labs to use the same software platform. | **Yes.** |
| **Offline Proof** | **Strong.** The sticker is the anchor; no network needed to verify. | **None.** Requires server/database access. | **Manual.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Factory Floor" reality. Quality inspectors don't want to log into an SAP or Fluke database every time they see a wrench. Live Verify turns the **Sticker on the Tool** into a live, trusted data-point, bringing "Metrology-Grade" trust to the point of use.
