## What is a Conviction Expungement Certificate?

An expungement certificate confirms that a criminal conviction has been legally erased, sealed, or set aside. The person can legally answer "no" to conviction questions on most applications. Different jurisdictions use different terms: expungement, sealing, set-aside, dismissal, or pardon.

This is life-changing documentation. Fraud includes fake expungements to pass background checks, or criminals misrepresenting the scope of what was actually expunged.

## Data Verified

Court/issuing authority, case number, petitioner/defendant name, original offense(s), conviction date, type of relief (expungement/sealing/pardon), grant date, scope of relief, any exceptions or limitations.

**Document Types:**
- **Expungement Order:** Court order erasing conviction from record.
- **Sealing Certificate:** Record sealed from public view but not destroyed.
- **Set-Aside Order:** Conviction set aside, plea withdrawn.
- **Pardon Certificate:** Executive clemency forgiving the offense.
- **Certificate of Relief:** Removes collateral consequences without expunging.

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the issuer domain (`courts.ca.gov`, `governor.virginia.gov`) and record status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Expunged** — Conviction legally erased.
- **Sealed** — Record exists but not publicly accessible.
- **Set Aside** — Conviction vacated, case dismissed.
- **Pardoned** — Offense forgiven by executive authority.
- **Pending Appeal** — Expungement granted but under appeal by prosecution.
- **Reversed** — Expungement reversed due to new offense or fraud.

## Second-Party Use

The **Petitioner (Expungee)** benefits from verification.

**Employment Applications:** Many applications ask about convictions. A verified expungement proves the person can legally answer "no" and provides documentation if the record still appears in background checks.

**Professional Licensing:** Licensing boards often disqualify applicants with certain convictions. Verified expungement proves eligibility.

**Housing Applications:** Landlords conducting background checks. Verified expungement explains why the record shouldn't disqualify the applicant.

**Firearm Rights Restoration:** Some expungements restore firearm rights. Verified documentation proves eligibility to pass NICS checks.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers**
**Background Check Interpretation:** When background checks return expunged records (some databases lag), employers need verified expungement orders to know the record is legally irrelevant.

**Background Check Companies**
**Database Updates:** (Checkr, Sterling, HireRight) use verified expungement orders to update their databases and stop reporting expunged records.

**Professional Licensing Boards**
**Eligibility Determination:** Boards verify that convictions claimed as expunged are actually expunged before granting licenses.

**Immigration Attorneys**
**Visa Applications:** Some expungements affect immigration consequences. Verified orders clarify the applicant's legal status.

**Public Defenders / Legal Aid**
**Verification Services:** Helping clients prove their expungements are valid when encountering stale records.

## Verification Architecture

**The Expungement Fraud Problem**

- **Fake Expungements:** Forged court orders claiming convictions were expunged.
- **Scope Inflation:** Claiming all convictions expunged when only one was.
- **Jurisdiction Shopping:** Using expungement from one state to claim clean record in another.
- **Stale Records:** Legitimate expungements not reflected in background check databases.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**State Courts:** Issue expungement and sealing orders.
**Governor's Offices:** Issue pardons and executive clemency.
**Pardon Boards:** (Federal, state) formal pardon review bodies.
**Federal Courts:** Federal conviction expungements (rare, limited cases).

**Background Check Integration**

Background check companies could query court verification endpoints when records appear in searches. If the court returns "Expunged" status, the record would be automatically suppressed from reports.

**Clean Slate Act Compliance**

States with automatic sealing laws (Pennsylvania, Michigan, etc.) could issue verification hashes for automatically sealed records, allowing subjects to prove their eligibility.

**Multi-State Challenges**

Expungement in one state doesn't automatically clear records in other states' databases. Verified expungement orders help individuals prove their status across jurisdictions.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

UK courts issue conviction expungement and record sealing orders under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.

```
✓ courts.gov.uk/expungement/verify — UK courts expungement and record sealing service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the court's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (case number, expungement or sealing order date, filing date, jurisdiction, record type) — never defendant name or conviction details — providing non-repudiation of the expungement and an audit trail for employment and background check disputes.
