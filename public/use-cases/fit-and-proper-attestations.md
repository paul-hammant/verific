## What is a Fit and Proper Attestation?

Individuals in certain financial services roles must be "fit and proper" — meaning they have the competence, character, and financial soundness to do their job honestly and effectively.

Under regimes like SM&CR (UK) or FINRA (US), firms must annually attest that staff in certified roles remain fit and proper. This isn't just a checkbox — firms must actively assess honesty, integrity, reputation, competence, and financial soundness.

## Data Verified

**Employee name**, **role/function**, **firm name**, **assessment date**, **certification period**, **competencies confirmed**, **certifying officers**, **next renewal date**.

## Data Visible After Verification

**Status Indications:**
- **Certified** — Current attestation valid
- **Expired** — Renewal overdue
- **Suspended** — Certification withdrawn pending investigation
- **Revoked** — Individual no longer meets fit and proper standards
- **Not Certified** — Role does not require certification

## Why No Public Registry?

The FCA Register shows Senior Managers (SMF) who require individual FCA approval. But **Certification Function** staff (the much larger population) are certified by firms, not the FCA. There's no public registry of certified staff — only the firm knows who they've certified.

When hiring, a new employer must conduct their own fit and proper assessment. Verification of prior attestations helps — but there's currently no standard way to prove someone was certified at their previous firm.

## Jurisdiction Differences

| Jurisdiction | Regulator | Framework | Who's Covered |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **UK** | FCA/PRA | SM&CR (Senior Managers & Certification Regime) | Senior Managers (FCA-approved) + Certified Staff (firm-certified) |
| **US** | FINRA, SEC | Form U4, Continuing Ed | Registered representatives, investment advisers |
| **EU** | National | MiFID II suitability, Fit & Proper Directive | Senior management, key function holders |

UK SM&CR is the most developed regime; US has fragmented oversight across FINRA/SEC/state; EU varies by country.

## Third-Party Use

**Recruiting firms** — Verify candidate was certified at prior employer
**Regulators** — Thematic reviews of certification practices
**Employment lawyers** — Evidence in wrongful dismissal cases ("you revoked certification without basis")
**Background check services** — Employment verification with certification status

## Verification Architecture

**The Problem:**
- Former employers may refuse to confirm certification status
- Candidates may claim certifications they never held
- Firms may backdate revocations after misconduct emerges

**The Fix:** Annual attestation hashed at issuance. Employee receives copy. When moving jobs, candidate can prove: "I was certified for CF30 at Firm X from 2020-2026" — with cryptographic proof the attestation is authentic.

**Revocation visibility:** If certification is revoked mid-year, verification status changes. New employer querying an old attestation sees "Revoked" status — critical for preventing bad actors from moving between firms.


## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Regulated

Financial firms attest that staff in certified roles remain fit and proper for their duties.

```
✓ smcr.fca.org.uk/verify — Authorized financial firm issuing fit and proper attestation
  ✓ fca.org.uk/register — Regulates UK financial services governance
    ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the firm's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (employee names, role/function, firm name, assessment dates, certification periods) — never sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the attestation and certification status.
