## What is an Event Venue Staff Badge?

At a concert, conference, sporting event, or festival, hundreds of temporary staff, contractors, and vendors move through backstage areas, VIP sections, and equipment zones. A security manager cannot possibly know every person working the event.

A **"Credential" or "Access Badge"** issued for the event proves the wearer is an authorized worker or vendor for that specific event.

Impostors pose multiple threats: they can steal high-value equipment (lighting rigs, sound systems, cameras), pirate backstage access to VIP areas, plant security threats, or exploit temporary chaos to commit fraud. E-Ink badges with real-time access status allow security teams to instantly verify any person's authorization, role, and access level—preventing unauthorized equipment theft, access escalation, and security breaches.

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the security team's perspective. Workers, contractors, and vendors arrive throughout setup and the event itself.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** Anyone with apparent backstage access can reach high-value equipment, VIP areas, and restricted zones — and challenging them slows operations during a time-pressured event.

**Verification asymmetry:** Security staff are being asked to admit or challenge people in real time across a large venue, but lack a fast independent way to confirm whether a given badge is current, the person matches the role, and their access level is correct for that zone.

*The server rotates the salt — after each successful scan (burn-on-verify) or on TTL expiry of an unscanned salt — and the badge re-renders to match. The screen is always in lockstep with the salt the server will honour, so a photograph is worthless unless verified in the moment. See [E-Ink ID Cards](../e-ink-id-cards.md) for how this prevents cloning and zone-hopping.*

## Data Verified

Staff or contractor name, photo (hash), company affiliation, role/position (Setup Crew, Security, AV Tech, Vendor, Catering, Talent Handler, etc.), assigned area/zone access (Backstage, VIP, Equipment Room, Vendor Hall, etc.), access level (time-bound: Friday 6 PM – Saturday 2 AM), credentialing date, and manager authorization (hash).

**Document Types:**
- **Event Staff Credential:** Temporary badge issued for a specific event, valid for a date range and shift
- **Vendor/Contractor Access Pass:** Contracted companies (security, catering, AV) authorized for event
- **Talent Handler Credential:** Personal security, agents, or management authorized with talent
- **Crew Credential:** Setup, breakdown, and active-event temporary workers

## Data Visible After Verification

Shows the event/venue domain (e.g., `coachella-festival.com`, `metcenter-events.com`) and current access status.

**Status Indications:**
- **Authorized Now** — Staff member is currently authorized to be on the event site within their assigned area and time window
- **Not Yet Authorized** — Credential is valid but the scheduled time window hasn't started
- **Access Expired** — Time window for access has ended (e.g., Friday night crew trying to access Saturday morning)
- **Suspended** — **ALERT:** Access revoked due to security incident, suspected theft, or removed from event
- **Unauthorized Area** — Staff trying to access a restricted area they're not credentialed for (e.g., crew member trying to enter VIP)

**Photo in verification response:** The verification endpoint should return a `photo_url` — a hash-based, no-cache photo of the credential holder. This is the primary defence against credential sharing and lanyard passing: security scans the badge, the photo appears, and they compare it to the person wearing the badge. Without the photo, a passed lanyard verifies correctly (the credential is genuine) but the person wearing it is not the person it was issued to.

```json
{
  "status": "verified",
  "photo_url": "/photos/a3f2b8c9d4e5f6a7.jpg"
}
```

See [Verification Response Format — Photo URL Security](../../docs/Verification-Response-Format.md#photo-url-security) for hash-based filenames, no-cache headers, and screen-capture prevention.

## Second-Party Use

The **Event Staff Member or Contractor** benefits from verification.

**Professional Credibility:** Verification proves they're a legitimate contractor or authorized staff member, reducing friction with other teams and security
**Access Efficiency:** Real-time verification speeds up area-to-area movement, reducing bottlenecks when moving equipment or supporting events
**Liability Protection:** Timestamped verification records prove they were authorized to be in specific areas, protecting against theft accusations or liability disputes

## Third-Party Use

**Event Security & Management**
**Real-Time Access Control:** Security can instantly verify anyone's authorization at checkpoints, backstage entries, equipment areas, and VIP zones—preventing unauthorized access
**Theft & Loss Prevention:** Verified entry logs show exactly who accessed equipment areas and VIP sections, enabling swift investigation of theft
**Incident Response:** During emergencies (medical, security threats), security knows instantly whether someone claiming to be a staff member is actually authorized
**Efficiency:** Reduces friction with dozens of contractors; credential scanning is faster than radio-checking with management
**Audit Trail:** Creating cryptographic proof of who was where and when, protecting the venue from liability claims and insurance disputes

**Equipment & Asset Management**
**High-Value Equipment Tracking:** Knowing which contractors accessed equipment areas helps track responsibility for missing gear
**Vendor Accountability:** Documenting which vendors accessed VIP areas, green rooms, or restricted zones protects against vendor-related theft or security breaches
**Disaster Recovery:** After events with loss or damage, verified access logs pinpoint when and who was in affected areas

**Law Enforcement & Investigators**
**Post-Incident Investigation:** If theft, assault, or terrorism-related activities occur, verified access logs provide a timeline and suspect list
**Search Warrants:** Verified access records can support investigations into specific individuals

## Verification Architecture

**The "Impostor Contractor" Fraud Problem**

- **Equipment Theft:** Impostors wearing credentials (or stolen/forged badges) gain access to equipment areas and load out high-value lighting, sound, or camera equipment
- **VIP/Talent Access:** Impostors pretending to be security, handlers, or managers gain unauthorized access to VIP areas, artist green rooms, or dressing rooms
- **Credential Fraud:** Counterfeit or duplicate badges created before the event; stolen badges from legitimate contractors
- **Credential Sharing / Lanyard Passing:** A legitimate VIP or "special guest" hands their lanyard or pass to a friend, assuming their status entitles them to share access. This is one of the most common credential compromises at events — it isn't malicious, but it defeats access control just as effectively as a forgery. The person wearing the pass is not the person it was issued to.
- **Social Engineering:** Impostors with basic knowledge of event operations blend in, following legitimate staff into restricted areas
- **Security Threat:** Unknown operatives gain event access for reconnaissance or to plant threats

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Event Promoters & Venues:** (Live Nation, AEG, Ticketmaster, local venues) issuing temporary staff credentials
**Event Management Companies:** (Specialized event security and logistics firms)
**Subcontractors:** (Security companies, catering firms, AV providers) issuing temporary credentials to their own staff
**Talent Management:** (Talent agencies, tour promoters) issuing credentials for artists and their teams

**Privacy Salt:** Important. Knowing which crew members were backstage with which artists could enable stalking or unauthorized photography. Hashes must be salted to prevent inference of access patterns.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial

Event venues and promoters issue staff verification credentials to confirm that workers are currently authorized to be present in restricted event areas. Self-authorized by their operational control of the event and venue licensing.

```
✓ staff.aeg-presents.co.uk/verify — Issues event venue staff credentials and access authorizations
```

Commercial issuer — self-authorized. Trust rests on the issuer's domain reputation.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the event organizer's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (staff names, roles, assigned zones, access times, company affiliations, manager authorizations) — never event locations or attendee details — providing non-repudiation of the credential and an audit trail event insurance providers and local authorities can inspect.

## Competition vs. Printed Badges / Radio Check-In

| Feature | Live Verify | Printed/Laminated Badge | Radio Check-In | Visual Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Verified by event organizer or contractor. | **Visual.** Badge design only; easily counterfeited. | **Human.** Radio operator may not have latest info. | **Visual.** Uniform and appearance-based. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds person to role and time window. | **Zero.** Printed badges can be faked, duplicated, or stolen. | **Low.** Subject to social engineering; radio lag. | **None.** Appearance is unreliable. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 3-second scan; instant verification. | **N/A.** Just looking at badge. | **Slow.** 30-60 seconds for radio verification; line backups. | **Instant but unreliable.** |
| **Freshness** | **Real-time.** Shows revoked status, time window expiry, area restrictions. | **Static.** Badge never changes; can't reflect post-issuance revocations. | **Variable.** Depends on radio operator updates. | **Static.** Can't capture real-time suspensions. |
| **Handles Revocation** | **Yes.** Instant if someone is removed mid-event. | **No.** Revoked staff can still use old badge. | **Maybe.** Requires radio discipline; chaos during events. | **No.** Appearance doesn't change if status changes. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The **"Checkpoint Workflow."** Event venues have multiple access checkpoints, multiple security teams, and constant flow of hundreds of people. Security cannot memorize who's authorized; they can't radio check every person; and they need instant, cryptographic proof. Live Verify provides verifiable, real-time access control at the point of entry.

## Adoption Nuances: The Logistics Bottleneck

**For event venues and promoters evaluating implementation:**

**Just-In-Time Badge Printing:** Event contractors arrive 2-3 days before setup. You don't have time for a 3-week badge process. You need rapid printing (24 hours or less) or on-site badge kiosks. Budget for this infrastructure upfront.

**Multi-Company Coordination:** Setup involves 5+ contractors (security, catering, AV, talent handlers, event staff). They all need badges issued by 5 different companies. Who coordinates? Who enforces? This is a *coordination problem*, not a technology problem. If one company doesn't adopt, the system breaks.

**Post-Event Badge Destruction:** After the event, you have 500 single-use e-Ink badges. Do you recycle? Destroy? Store? Budget for secure destruction (GDPR/privacy regulation applies).

**Implementation Timeline:** 6-9 months to implement, but with higher ongoing logistics burden—each event = badge coordination cycle. Only makes sense for high-value events with repeat contractor teams.
