## What is a Surveyor or Meter Reader Badge?

When you open your door to someone claiming to be from the council, the utility company, or a surveying firm, you are letting a stranger into your private home.

The **Verified Badge** is the worker's digital or physical ID. It proves:
1.  **Professional Registration:** They are a genuine chartered surveyor, registered appraiser, or authorized meter reader—not an imposter.
2.  **Current Status:** They are in good standing with their regulatory body and qualified to access your property.
3.  **Authorization:** They work for a legitimate firm or utility company and have genuine authority to conduct the inspection or reading.

"Bogus Caller" scams are a well-documented fraud pattern. Criminals pose as surveyors, meter readers, or appraisers to case properties for later burglary, steal valuables during the "survey," or commit mortgage fraud. Live Verify allows a homeowner to scan the credential at the door and see a green "ACTIVE" status from the regulatory authority, ensuring only legitimate professionals enter the home.

**Perspective:** This use case is written from the homeowner's perspective. The visit is initiated by the utility company, council, or surveying firm.

**Institutional power asymmetry:** The utility or council can restrict services, delay valuations, or report non-access — and the homeowner may face penalties or delays for refusing entry.

**Verification asymmetry:** The homeowner is being asked to grant access to private property immediately, but lacks a fast independent way to confirm the person at the door is a current, authorized professional with a legitimate reason to enter.

**Why would you bother checking?** Because they need to enter your home. A meter reader who stays outside at the external meter box is low-risk. But when the meter is inside, or the surveyor needs to inspect every room, you are granting a stranger unsupervised access to private space. The person who arrives may not be the person the company dispatched: a registered surveyor subcontracts to an unqualified assistant, or a terminated meter reader keeps their old badge. The verification response includes a `photo_url` field — the badge verifies, but the face doesn't match, and the substitution is caught before entry.

## Data Verified

Worker name, photo (hash), professional registration number, firm affiliation, qualification level (MRICS/FRICS or equivalent), role (surveyor/appraiser/meter reader), current assignment status, issuing regulatory body.

**Document Types:**
- **Professional ID Card:** Carried by the individual surveyor, meter reader, or appraiser.
- **Site Appointment Letter:** (Linked hash) proving the authorized visit to the property.
- **Professional Indemnity Certificate:** Proving the worker is covered by liability insurance.
- **Registration Verification Letter:** For high-trust property access scenarios.

## Verification Response

The endpoint returns a simple status code:

- **ACTIVE** — Registration is valid and in good standing; worker is qualified to access property
- **SUSPENDED** — Registration suspended due to disciplinary action; do not permit entry
- **STRUCK_OFF** — Removed from register permanently; worker has no authority to conduct inspections
- **EXPIRED** — Registration lapsed or renewal pending; do not permit entry without further verification
- **404** — Registration not found (forged badge, wrong issuer, or OCR error)

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the badge itself (e.g., `members.rics.org`).

## Post-Verification Actions

After successful verification, homeowners may record the property access visit:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Status: ACTIVE

--- Optional Follow-Up ---

You may record details of this property access visit.
You will NEVER be told not to do this or that it is not needed.

POST to: https://members.rics.org/property-visits/record

Fields:
- Visitor name: [Auto-filled from verification]
- Visit reason: [Survey / Valuation / Meter Reading / Appraisal / Other]
- Work completed: [Yes / Partially / No / Incomplete]
- Duration: [0-30 min / 30-60 min / 1-2 hours / 2+ hours]
- Property access: [Front entrance / Full access / Limited areas]
- Any concerns or unusual behavior?
- Would you allow return visit? [Y/N]
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Fraud detection:** Pattern analysis of failed verifications or impersonation attempts at specific addresses
- **Consumer protection:** Creates contemporaneous record if property damage or theft occurs during visit
- **Professional accountability:** Regulatory bodies can investigate complaints tied to verified visits
- **Bogus caller deterrent:** Criminals know homeowners can easily report and verify; reduces impersonation attempts
- **Insurance documentation:** Proves legitimate professional was on-site if liability questions arise

**The "Never Discouraged" Principle:**

Surveyors and meter readers should never tell homeowners "don't bother" or "that's not necessary" with recording visits. Every report is logged. The regulatory body can triage later—but the homeowner is never made to feel their input isn't wanted.

## Second-Party Use

The **Surveyor, Meter Reader, or Appraiser** benefits from verification.

**Customer Trust:** Proving to a homeowner at the door that they are a verified professional registered with a legitimate regulatory authority. This removes the "Bogus Caller" friction and allows the worker to access the property faster and conduct their work with cooperation rather than suspicion.

**Professional Credibility:** Including a "Verified Registration Badge" in appointment confirmations and professional correspondence to win more work from premium clients who value security and authenticity.

**Faster Site Access:** Homeowners are more willing to grant immediate property access when they see a green "ACTIVE" status from a trusted authority, reducing delays and callbacks.

## Third-Party Use

**Homeowners (Vulnerable Residents)**
**Personal Safety:** Before opening the door, a resident (or their remote family via doorbell cam) can scan the badge. "Verified by Regulatory Authority" ensures the person at the door isn't a fake surveyor, bogus meter reader, or criminal impersonating a utility company worker.

**Property Protection:** Confirming that visitors claiming to conduct property surveys or valuations are genuinely authorized and registered, preventing "casing" by burglars and theft during inspections.

**Mortgage Lenders**
**Surveyor Credibility:** Verifying that surveyors conducting property valuations for mortgage applications are genuinely registered and in good standing, preventing mortgage fraud schemes where fake appraisers inflate property values.

**Valuation Integrity:** Confirming the surveyor's qualification level (MRICS/FRICS or equivalent) to ensure valuations meet regulatory standards for lending decisions.

**Insurance Companies**
**Appraiser Verification:** Verifying that property appraisers conducting damage assessments or valuations for insurance claims are licensed and qualified, preventing claim fraud.

**Loss Prevention:** Identifying patterns of suspicious "inspections" at properties that later suffer theft or damage, flagging potential insurance fraud or criminal casing.

**Property Developers & Real Estate Firms**
**Building Surveyor Verification:** Confirming that building surveyors conducting structural assessments and due diligence inspections are genuinely qualified and registered, especially for large commercial transactions.

**Compliance Documentation:** Creating audit trails of verified professional inspections for regulatory compliance and liability protection.

## Verification Architecture

**The "Bogus Caller" Fraud Problem**

- **Impersonation:** Criminals posing as "Council Surveyors," "Meter Readers," or "Water Board Inspectors" to gain entry to homes to steal valuables or case properties for later burglary.
- **Authority Forging:** Fake appointments or forged credentials claiming property inspection is required by law, using psychological pressure to gain entry.
- **Mortgage Fraud:** Fake appraisers or valuers inflating property values in collusion with dishonest lenders or borrowers.
- **Utility Fraud:** Impersonating meter readers to access properties, steal identifying information, or case homes for robbery.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**UK - RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors):** Regulates and registers all chartered surveyors, valuers, and property consultants in the UK.

**US - State Appraisal Boards:** Each US state regulates licensed real estate appraisers (e.g., California Real Estate Appraisers Board).

**Utility Companies:** Natural gas, electricity, water, and telecommunications providers employ or contract meter readers; many now offer verification endpoints.

**Local Authorities & Councils:** Council surveyors and building control officers authorized to conduct statutory inspections.

**Trade Associations:** Professional bodies like the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) maintaining registries of qualified appraisers.

**Privacy Salt:** Highly critical. Surveyor/appraiser and property location data is sensitive. The hash MUST be salted to prevent "Mass Scraping" of surveyor routes and property inspection patterns that could enable targeted burglary.

## Authority Chain

**Dual Pattern:** UK Government-Regulated + Commercial Self-Authorized

**UK (RICS-regulated):**

```
✓ members.rics.org/verify — RICS chartered surveyor registration
  ✓ rics.org — Regulates UK chartered surveyors and valuers
```

Commercial issuer — RICS is a royal charter body with statutory authority over UK surveyors. Trust rests on RICS domain reputation and regulatory standing.

**US (California state-regulated):**

```
✓ brea.ca.gov/verify — California licensed real estate appraiser
  ✓ california.gov — California state government
```

Government issuer — California state appraisal board is a government agency with statutory authority. Trust rests on California government domain.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the regulator's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (registration number, professional name, qualification level, status date) — never property addresses or surveyor routes — providing non-repudiation of the registration and an audit trail homeowners and regulators can inspect.

## Competition vs. Review Sites (Yelp / Google)

| Feature | Live Verify | Review Sites (Yelp/Google) | Physical ID Card |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Anchor** | **Domain-Bound.** Bound to regulatory authority. | **Social-Bound.** Trusted only via crowd opinion. | **Zero.** Easily forged. |
| **Integrity** | **Cryptographic.** Binds face to registration status. | **Vulnerable.** Reviews can be faked/bought. | **None.** |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan at the door. | **Slow.** Requires reading multiple reviews. | **Instant.** |
| **Safety Data** | **High.** Shows current registration status and authority. | **None.** Only shows quality of work. | **N/A.** |
| **Access Control** | **Real-time gate.** Homeowner can refuse entry immediately. | **Retroactive.** Only useful after bad experience. | **None.** Already at the door. |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The "Threshold Moment." Homeowners make the decision to open the door in seconds. They don't want to read 50 Yelp reviews while a stranger in a high-vis vest stands on their porch. Live Verify turns the **ID Badge** into a live, non-confrontational safety tool that provides instant, high-authority verification at the moment of maximum vulnerability—the property threshold.
