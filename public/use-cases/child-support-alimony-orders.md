## What is a Child Support or Alimony Order?

A family court orders a non-custodial parent to pay $2,200/month in child support. The order is sent to the parent's employer for wage garnishment. The employer's payroll department receives a PDF. Is it real? Is it current? Has it been modified? Could a disgruntled ex-spouse have fabricated or altered the order to inflate the amount? Could the paying parent present an old, lower amount to a new employer while the actual order has been increased?

These orders sit at the intersection of family law, employment law, and finance. They flow between courts, parents, employers, banks, and government enforcement agencies. Every link in that chain currently relies on paper or unverifiable PDFs. The stakes are high — children's welfare depends on correct amounts being collected, and paying parents need protection against fabricated or inflated orders.

With Live Verify, the court order carries a `verify:` line bound to the family court's domain. The employer's payroll department, the bank processing garnishment, the enforcement agency — all scan and get real-time confirmation of the order's authenticity and current terms.

## Data Verified

Court name, case number, order type (child support / spousal support / both), petitioner name, respondent name, monthly amount, payment frequency, effective date, income withholding directive (yes/no), arrears amount (if any). NOT included: custody arrangements, parenting time, underlying financial disclosures.

**Document Types:**
- **Child Support Order:** Court-ordered payments for the benefit of minor children.
- **Spousal Support / Alimony Order:** Court-ordered payments to a former spouse (maintenance, spousal maintenance).
- **Combined Order:** Both child support and spousal support in a single order.
- **Income Withholding Order (IWO):** The directive sent to an employer to garnish wages.
- **Modification Order:** A subsequent order changing the amount or terms.

## Verification Response

- **ACTIVE** — Order is in effect at the stated amount
- **MODIFIED** — Amount or terms have been changed by the court (returns current amount)
- **SUSPENDED** — Payments temporarily suspended (e.g., incarceration, disability)
- **SATISFIED** — All obligations fulfilled (children aged out, or lump-sum settlement paid)
- **ARREARS** — Order is active and respondent is in arrears (returns arrears amount)
- **DISMISSED** — Order was vacated
- **404** — No matching record

The issuer domain is visible from the `verify:` line on the order itself (e.g., `nycourts.gov`).

## Second-Party Use

Both parents.

**The Receiving Parent:** Proving the order exists and its current amount to employers, banks, and enforcement agencies. When a paying parent changes jobs, the receiving parent needs to serve the new employer with the withholding order — and the new employer needs to verify it's real.

**The Paying Parent:** Proving compliance with the order. Proving the correct amount to a new employer (preventing an ex-spouse from presenting an inflated or fabricated order). Proving the order was satisfied or modified downward. When a paying parent is current on payments but an employer receives what looks like an arrears notice — verification settles the dispute immediately.

## Third-Party Use

**Employers / Payroll Departments**
The primary enforcement mechanism. Employers are legally required to comply with income withholding orders, and they face liability for non-compliance. But they also face liability for garnishing based on a fraudulent order. Verification resolves the dilemma — scan the order, confirm it's real, process the withholding.

**State Child Support Enforcement Agencies (OCSE, CSE)**
Federal and state agencies that locate non-custodial parents, establish paternity, and enforce orders across state lines. Verification streamlines interstate enforcement — a New York order being enforced by a California employer can be verified against the New York court's domain.

**Banks**
Processing garnishment orders, freezing accounts for arrears, intercepting funds. Banks currently have no efficient way to verify that a garnishment order is authentic before freezing an account.

**New Employers**
When the paying parent changes jobs, the income withholding order follows. The new employer receives a document from either the custodial parent, a state agency, or the court. Verification confirms it's legitimate and current.

**Tax Authorities**
The IRS and state tax agencies intercept tax refunds for child support arrears. Verification of the underlying order and arrears amount prevents erroneous intercepts.

**Credit Bureaus**
Child support arrears affect credit reports. Verification of arrears amounts prevents inaccurate reporting.

**Passport Agencies**
The US State Department denies passport issuance and renewal for individuals with $2,500+ in child support arrears. Verification of the order and arrears status is the decision point.

**Immigration Authorities**
Child support compliance can affect immigration proceedings.

**Family Law Attorneys**
Verifying opposing party's claimed order terms — the amount, the effective date, whether it's been modified.

## Verification Architecture — Child Support Order Fraud

- **Fabricated orders** to extract money from an ex-partner's employer. A forged income withholding order sent to payroll can result in months of garnishment before the fraud is discovered.
- **Altered amounts** — inflating the court-ordered amount on a copy sent to the employer, or deflating it on a copy shown to a new partner.
- **Presenting an old, superseded order** with a lower amount to a new employer while the actual order has been increased. The paying parent changes jobs and "forgets" to mention the modification.
- **Claiming an order was dismissed** when it wasn't, to avoid garnishment at a new employer.
- **Interstate enforcement complexity** — an order from New York, an employer in California. The California employer receives a withholding order referencing a New York case number. Is it real? Currently, they'd have to call the Westchester County Family Court clerk. With Live Verify, they scan and confirm against `nycourts.gov`.
- **The MODIFIED status is critical:** orders are frequently modified as circumstances change (job loss, raise, child aging out, remarriage), and all parties need to know the current amount. A verification response that returns the current court-ordered amount alongside the MODIFIED status prevents enforcement of stale terms.

**Issuer Types** (First Party)

**Family Courts:** The primary issuers of support orders.
**State Child Support Enforcement Agencies:** Issue income withholding orders and arrears certifications.
**Administrative Law Judges:** Some states allow administrative (non-judicial) establishment of support orders.

## Privacy Salt

High sensitivity. Family court matters are private. The existence of a child support order reveals divorce, out-of-wedlock children, and financial obligations. Names of minor children are embedded in the order. The hash MUST be salted with a high-entropy random value (printed on the document) to prevent enumeration attacks — no one should be able to guess-and-check hashes to discover whether a specific person has a child support order.

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Sovereign

UK family courts administer child support and alimony orders under the Child Support Act 1991 and family law statutes.

```
✓ csa.gov.uk/orders/verify — UK Child Support Agency order enforcement service
  ✓ gov.uk/verifiers — UK government root namespace
```

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) for the full protocol.

## Competition vs. Existing Systems

| Feature | Live Verify | State SDU (State Disbursement Unit) | Calling the Court | OCSE Federal Systems | Trusting the Paper |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | **Real-time order verification.** Confirms authenticity, amount, and current status. | **Payment processing.** Routes payments from employer to custodial parent. Does not verify orders for employers. | **Manual verification.** Call the clerk, wait on hold, hope someone answers. | **Enforcement coordination.** Federal Parent Locator Service, interstate case registry. Not employer-accessible in real-time. | **No verification.** Trust what the paper says. |
| **Speed** | **Instant.** 5-second scan. | **N/A.** Not a verification service. | **Slow.** Hours to days. Court clerks are overwhelmed. | **Slow.** Designed for agency-to-agency, not employer-facing. | **Instant.** But unreliable. |
| **Employer Access** | **Yes.** Any employer with a phone camera. | **No.** Employers interact with SDU only to remit payments. | **Technically yes.** Practically, court phone lines are a nightmare. | **No.** Not designed for employer queries. | **Yes.** But no fraud protection. |
| **Detects Modifications** | **Yes.** MODIFIED status with current amount. | **No.** SDU processes whatever amount it receives. | **Maybe.** If the clerk checks and tells you. | **Eventually.** Case registries update, but not in real-time for employers. | **No.** |

**Why Live Verify wins here:** The gap is employer-facing verification. Employers are the enforcement mechanism — they garnish wages — but they have no efficient way to verify that the order they received is authentic and current. SDUs process payments; they don't verify orders. OCSE coordinates between agencies; it doesn't serve employers. The court clerk's phone line is perpetually busy. Live Verify fills a gap that no existing system addresses.

## Jurisdictional Witnessing (Optional)

An independent witness layer may apply — see [Witnessing Third Parties](../../docs/WITNESSING-THIRD-PARTIES.md) for the full mechanism (what a witness receives, non-repudiation, optional public-blockchain rollups). For this use case: a witness would receive the court's hashes and status changes plus structured metadata (key identifiers, dates) — never plaintext or sensitive personal information — providing non-repudiation of the order it issued.

### This Protects Both Parents

The custodial parent needs the employer to garnish the correct amount — not a lower figure from an outdated or altered order. The paying parent needs protection against a fabricated order that inflates the amount, or an old order presented to a new employer after the court reduced the obligation. Both sides are vulnerable to document manipulation in opposite directions, and both benefit from the same verification mechanism: the employer scans the order, the court's domain confirms it is current, and the amount is what the judge actually ordered. Neither parent can game the system, and neither parent is victimized by the other's forgery.

## Further Derivations

1. **Property division orders** — Court orders dividing marital assets (real estate, retirement accounts, business interests). Banks, title companies, and pension administrators all need to verify these orders before transferring assets. Same verification architecture: court issues the order, parties and institutions scan to confirm authenticity and current status.
2. **Income withholding orders for other debts** — Student loans, tax liens, bankruptcy wage orders. The same employer garnishment mechanism applies: employer receives a withholding directive, needs to verify it's real before deducting from an employee's paycheck. The pattern is identical; only the issuer and statute change.
