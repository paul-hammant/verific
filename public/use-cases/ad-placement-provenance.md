## The Problem

A web page is a single second party — the publisher whose URL you visited — but the advertisement
you see was placed by a chain of parties the page never names. A creative is sold by an advertiser,
brokered through an ad network, auctioned across one or more exchanges, and delegated through
re-sellers before something is injected into the page. Hundreds of domains may participate in the
decision to place a single ad. (For a working illustration of that recursion, see the
[ad-infinitum demo](https://github.com/paul-hammant/ad-infinitum), which simulates the chain of
advertising-service domains that can inject content into an arbitrary page.)

> Ads are the highest-stakes instance of a more general thing: **[web-page region
> provenance](../../docs/web-page-region-provenance.md)** — *who placed any third-party-injected
> region of a page here, and who stands behind it?* This use case applies that primitive where the
> fraud, liability, and regulatory stakes are greatest.

When something goes wrong — a malvertising payload, a scam creative, a deceptive "you've won"
banner — the end user has **no way to ask "who placed this?"** The publisher washes their hands ("we
didn't serve it"); the ad network is invisible; the exchange is invisible; the re-seller is
invisible. Accountability dissolves into the chain precisely because the chain is hidden from the
one person harmed by it.

This use case does **not** claim to stop malvertising or to vet ad code for safety — ad payloads are
dynamic, per-impression executable code, and verifying their *safety* is a different problem with
different tooling. What it does is make the **provenance and liability chain of a specific ad
placement visible to the end user, on demand, as a deliberate action** — turning "who placed this?"
from an unanswerable question into a right-click.

## What the user actions

The verifiable artifact is not the ad's pixels or its code — it is a short, signed **placement
manifest**: a human-readable statement of *which parties stood in the chain that put this ad here*,
each vouching for the link below it. The user surfaces it by an explicit gesture:

1. **Right-click the ad** (or long-press on mobile) and choose **"Show ad provenance."**
2. The browser/extension reads the placement manifest bound to that ad slot and **walks its
   provenance chain** — the same `authorizedBy` walk Live Verify already uses for credential
   [authority chains](../../docs/authority-chain-app-display.md), here applied to liability rather
   than credentials.
3. A panel renders the chain **origin-to-page**, from the **advertiser** (why the ad exists), through
   every **ad reseller** that passed the placement onward, to the **ad presenter** that put it on the
   page — each party's role assigned by the browser from its position in the chain, not from what the
   party calls itself.

The user took an action; the user got an answer. Nothing ran automatically, nothing was verified
behind their back, and the result is attribution — not a safety verdict.

## No clip path: ad provenance is live-only

Every other Live Verify use case has a **clip / photograph / OCR** path — the claim is printed on a
document, and the verifiable text (with its `verify:` line) travels with it, so a person can capture and
check it anywhere. **Ad provenance has no such path, and cannot.** It is different in kind, for two
reasons:

- **The ad carries no visible `verify:` line or metadata.** The creative the reader sees is just the
  ad — "SleepWell, 50% OFF." The provenance is bound to the *slot* out-of-band, never printed on the
  advertiser's pixels. There is nothing on the ad to clip.
- **The subject is adversarial and lives *inside the page*.** A malicious ad, or a malicious page,
  could trivially draw its own fake "provenance: all clean" overlay if the mechanism were page
  JavaScript. So the check **must not run in the DOM.** It runs from **outside the page — in browser
  chrome (or an extension operating above the page)** — which the ad and the site cannot read,
  intercept, suppress, or forge. This is the [safe-sequence](../../docs/safe-sequence-platform-disclosure.md)
  model: the user turns verification inward via a gesture the page cannot touch, and the browser draws
  the result over the page.

That is why the panel above is styled as **browser chrome**, not as page content: it must be visually
unmistakable that *the browser is saying this, not the page.* A page-drawn look-alike is exactly the
attack this design exists to defeat.

**The honest weakness — browsers signal chrome-vs-page poorly today.** This use case depends on the
user being able to tell a browser-drawn panel from a page-drawn imitation, and current browsers are
**weak at that distinction.** Beyond the URL-bar padlock and permission prompts, there is little
consistent, spoof-resistant chrome vocabulary a page cannot mimic pixel-for-pixel inside its own
viewport. A convincing in-page fake of this very panel is achievable today. So this use case is partly
a **proposal to browser makers**: it needs a trustworthy, page-inaccessible surface for "the browser is
telling you this" — the same gap that makes SSL-certificate details trustworthy (they live in chrome the
page cannot write) but leaves most other browser-to-user messages forgeable. Until that surface is
stronger, the mechanism is sound but its weakest link is the user's ability to know the panel is
genuine.

## Example: The Provenance Reveal

**Step 1 — the ad, as placed.** A reader is partway through an article on `dailyexample-news.com`. An
injected banner sits mid-article — the reader has no idea which of hundreds of possible parties put it
there:

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 24px auto; font-family: -apple-system, sans-serif; border: 1px solid #ddd; background: #fff; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">
  <div style="padding: 16px 20px; color: #222; font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.5;">
    …the council confirmed the roadworks would continue into September, with
    diversions in place along the High Street. Residents are advised to&nbsp;…

  </div>
  <div style="padding: 8px 20px 16px; color: #222; font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.5;">
    …use alternative routes where possible. The works are part of a wider
    resurfacing programme scheduled to complete by year end.
  </div>
</div>

**Step 2 — the right-click.** Wondering who is behind the banner (or having landed on a scam version of
it), the reader **right-clicks the ad** (long-press on mobile). The context menu is drawn by the
*browser*, not the page, so the ad cannot suppress or fake it — the reader chooses **"Show ad
provenance."**

<div style="max-width: 300px; margin: 24px auto; font-family: -apple-system, sans-serif; border: 1px solid #bbb; border-radius: 8px; background: #fff; box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.18); overflow: hidden; font-size: 0.9em;">
  <div style="padding: 9px 16px; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Open image in new tab</div>
  <div style="padding: 9px 16px; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Copy image</div>

  <div style="padding: 9px 16px; color: #0b57d0; background: #eef4ff; font-weight: 600;">🔎 Show ad provenance</div>
  <div style="padding: 9px 16px; color: #333; border-top: 1px solid #eee;">Inspect</div>
</div>

**Step 3 — the reveal.** The browser reads the placement manifest bound to that slot, walks its chain,
and draws the panel:

<div style="max-width: 560px; margin: 24px auto; border: 1px solid #6b7280; border-radius: 10px; background: #f3f4f6; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.28); overflow: hidden; font-family: -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;">
  <div style="background: #e5e7eb; border-bottom: 1px solid #cbd0d8; padding: 8px 16px; font-size: 0.8em; color: #4b5563; display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px;">
    <span style="font-size: 1.1em;">🛡️</span>
    <span>Drawn by your browser — not by this page. This panel cannot be altered by the site or the ad.</span>
  </div>
  <div style="padding: 16px 20px; color: #111;">
    <div style="font-size: 0.72em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; color: #6b7280; text-transform: uppercase; margin-bottom: 10px;">Ad placement provenance</div>

    <div style="font-size: 0.78em; color: #6b7280; margin-bottom: 4px;">The ad, as placed:</div>
    <div style="border: 1px solid #d8dbe0; background: #fff; border-radius: 6px; padding: 10px 12px; font-size: 0.9em; color: #222; margin-bottom: 14px;">
      🛏️ SleepWell Memory-Foam Mattresses — 50% OFF<br>
      Ends Sunday. Free next-day delivery. → Shop now
    </div>

    <div style="font-size: 0.78em; color: #6b7280; margin-bottom: 6px;">Placed on <strong>dailyexample-news.com / article-body-mid</strong>, 15 Jun 2026 11:04 UTC. Chain, origin&nbsp;→&nbsp;page (each vouched for the one below):</div>
    <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: ui-monospace, 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.82em; line-height: 1.6; color: #111; white-space: pre;">  ▸ acme-mattresses.example      ADVERTISER
    ▸ brightreach.example        AD RESELLER
      ▸ getcheapclicks.example   AD RESELLER
        ▸ dailyexample-news.com  AD PRESENTER</pre>
  </div>
</div>

The panel is **drawn by the browser, over the page — not by the page's own JavaScript** (see
[No clip path: this use case is live-only](#no-clip-path-ad-provenance-is-live-only)). It shows **the ad
exactly as placed** (the creative text is the other half of the evidence, alongside the chain), then the
resolved chain of parties. There is no `verify:` line and nothing to clip: the browser already walked
and verified the chain out-of-band to draw this — the panel is the *result*, not a fresh claim.

Each role is a short label; hovering it (or tapping, on touch) shows what it means. The same
explanations are written out below so nothing depends on a hover:

<div style="max-width: 650px; margin: 8px auto 24px; font-family: -apple-system, sans-serif; font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.55; color: #333; border-left: 3px solid #1a5f2a; padding: 6px 16px;">
  <p style="margin: 6px 0;"><strong title="This ad exists to sell their product or service, or to entice you to click or tap for some reason.">ADVERTISER</strong> — this ad exists to sell their product or service, or to entice you to click or tap for some reason.</p>
  <p style="margin: 6px 0;"><strong title="Passed the ad's placement onward toward the page. There may be many, chained one after another; the depth is itself the signal.">AD RESELLER</strong> — passed the placement onward toward the page. There may be many, chained one after another; how deep the reselling goes is itself the signal.</p>
  <p style="margin: 6px 0;"><strong title="Put this ad on the page you are reading. The party a complaint lands on, and the one held to account.">AD PRESENTER</strong> — put this ad on the page you are reading. The party a complaint lands on, and the one held to account.</p>
</div>

The chain reads **origin to page**: the **advertiser** at the top is why the ad exists; each **ad
reseller** passed the placement onward (there may be many — the depth is the point); and the **ad
presenter** at the bottom is the party that put it on the page in front of the reader. If the banner
had instead been a malware dropper or a scam, the same panel names every party that handled it — and,
critically, names the presenter, who can no longer say "nothing to do with us."

### Three roles, and only three

The overlay deliberately uses **three plain roles**, not the ad-industry's dozen self-flattering job
titles:

- **Advertiser** — the origin. The ad exists to sell their product; they commissioned the creative.
  Topmost, because everything downstream serves their demand.
- **Ad reseller** — any intermediary that passed the placement onward. Exchanges, networks, DSPs,
  re-sellers-of-re-sellers — from the reader's point of view they are all the same role: *someone who
  resold this ad's placement toward the page.* There can be **N of them**, and how many is itself the
  signal.
- **Ad presenter** — the party that put the ad on the page the reader is on. The one a complaint lands
  on, and the one held to account (see below).

**Why not let each party name its own role?** Because they would all inflate it. Left to self-describe,
every reseller writes "Premium Exchange" or "Trusted Ad Partner" — never "reseller," let alone
"reseller number five." Self-description is structurally incapable of producing an honest rank, so the
overlay does not use it for the role at all.

### Where each line comes from

No single party authors the overlay — the whole point is to attribute actors who would deny
involvement, so none of them can be trusted to write it. The browser assembles it from separate
domains, and — crucially — **assigns the roles itself from the structure of the walk**, not from what
any party says about itself:

- **The chain's *shape* comes from the manifest bound to the slot**, walked upward: each party's record
  carries an `authorizedBy`-style pointer to the party it accepted its placement from — the same walk
  Live Verify uses for credential [authority chains](../../docs/authority-chain-app-display.md), here
  expressing *liability* rather than authorisation.
- **The *role* is derived by the browser from position in the confirmed walk, not self-published.** The
  leaf of the demand (the party nothing points *up* from) is the **advertiser**; the party whose domain
  serves the page the reader is on is the **ad presenter**; everything between them is an **ad
  reseller**, and the browser can label its depth ("reseller 2 of 3"). A party cannot self-declare a
  better rank — its position in the chain is a fact of who-attested-whom, which it does not control.
- **Only *identity* is self-published** — a party's `formalName` (e.g. "GetCheapClicks Media Ltd,
  company no. 08841772"), the registered company behind the domain, shown on tap. Lying about that is
  falsifiable fraud with a paper trail; lying about your *rank* is just marketing, which is why the one
  is trusted and the other is ignored.
- **A line is *confirmed* only if the party above it attests the one below.** `getcheapclicks.example`
  appears in the chain only because `brightreach.example` — the party above it — actually vouched that
  it accepted GetCheapClicks' placement. A reseller cannot insert itself unless the party above signed
  for it; an unconfirmed link renders **struck**, not hidden (see
  [Status Indications](#data-visible-after-verification)).

So the lines are independent GETs to independent domains, stitched by the walk: the manifest gives the
order, each domain gives only its *identity*, the browser assigns the *role* from structure, and each
upstream attestation confirms the link below it. The browser is the neutral assembler; no party writes
its own rank, and no party writes the whole overlay.

> **The functional kind of a reseller** — was hop 2 really an *auction exchange* or just a pass-through
> re-seller? — is not taken from its self-description either. It emerges from the *shape* of

> [ISNAD](../../docs/comparison-to-isnad.md) is built to derive, and Live Verify is not.

## Why the Ad Presenter is the Accountability Endpoint

The chain **terminates at the ad presenter's own domain** — the party whose page the reader is on. It
anchors there not because the presenter is *trusted* (it is the party most motivated to evade), but
because it is the one the harmed reader can actually reach and complain to, and the one the signed
chain **pins**.

The presenter's instinct, when a scam or malware ad is reported, is the neutral-conduit defence:
*"we didn't create that ad, we just host the page — it came through an ad chain we don't control."* In
the US that is the **Section 230** claim; in the EU it is the DSA hosting-provider defence; in the UK,
the Online Safety Act intermediary defences. All of them turn on the presenter being a **passive
conduit** that did not participate in placing the content.

**The signed provenance chain removes that defence.** The presenter's own domain sits in the chain,
carrying its own attestation — *"for this slot, I accepted this placement."* That is a record of
**active participation in placing the ad**, not passive hosting. A party that cryptographically vouched
for an ad appearing in its slot cannot then claim it was a neutral conduit with no hand in the
placement — the very manifest it signed is the evidence that it participated. The provenance mechanism
turns the presenter's "nothing to do with us" from an assertion into a falsifiable, self-signed claim
the chain contradicts.

- Each party in the chain signs "I accepted this placement from the party below me" — the presenter
  included. That is an attestation of **participation and liability**, not of safety.
- Whether the resellers were diligent (malware-sniffed the payload, held real indemnity) is a
  contractual matter between them — but the *existence and shape* of the signed chain is something the
  reader can surface at will.

**The evidentiary object is the whole chain plus the claim text.** What a reader (or a regulator, or
law enforcement) is handed is not just the presenter's name: it is the **complete resolved chain**
(advertiser → resellers → presenter, each link confirmed) **together with the verified text of the ad
itself** — the creative or scam copy that was actually shown. This package is **self-evidencing**: any
recipient can re-walk it and re-verify exactly what the reporter saw (see
[Chain-Escalated Reporting](../../docs/chain-escalated-reporting.md) and the reporting section below).
Crucially, it establishes **participation** — *who signed for this ad appearing where* — which is the
fact that defeats a neutral-conduit immunity, not merely *who to blame*.

**Honest limit.** Establishing participation is not establishing guilt. The chain proves *who
participated in placing this exact ad*; it does not prove the ad was unlawful, harmful, or that any
party breached a duty. That remains for a court. Provenance strips the "we weren't involved" evasion; it
does not adjudicate the wrong.

## Data Verified

The placement reference, the publisher slot, the issue timestamp, the ordered provenance chain
(each party's domain and self-published role description), and the salt. The manifest binds *which
parties stood in this placement's chain* — it does **not** bind, vouch for, or verify the ad's
creative content, its executable behaviour, or its safety.

**What is deliberately NOT included:**

- the ad's payload, creative, or code (this is provenance, not content verification)
- any safety, malware, or brand-safety verdict
- the auction price, bid data, or commercial terms
- any user-identifying or targeting data about the person who saw the ad

## Data Visible After Verification

The ordered chain of parties, top-down, each with its self-published role description (e.g. "Ad
exchange that ran the auction"), exactly as the credential authority-chain display works. Tapping a
party can reveal its `formalName` (the registered company behind the domain) where published.

**Status Indications:**
- **Chain Shown** — A signed manifest was found and the chain resolved end-to-end.
- **Unconfirmed Link** — A party in the chain claimed a voucher the party above did not confirm
  (rendered like a broken credential chain: that link is shown struck, not hidden).
- **No Manifest** — This ad slot carried no provenance manifest; the user is told plainly that
  provenance is unavailable for this placement (fail-loudly — never a fabricated or partial chain
  presented as complete).
- **Expired** — The placement manifest's validity window has passed (per-impression manifests are
  short-lived; the slot must re-issue).

## Second-Party Use

The **publisher** benefits directly. Signing and surfacing a provenance manifest:

- **Converts a liability they already bear into a transparency feature.** Users increasingly blame
  the site they were on for a bad ad; a publisher that can *show* the chain demonstrates it isn't
  the originator and that it proxied responsibly.
- **Creates a documentary record for dispute and indemnity.** When a malicious creative slips
  through, the publisher has a signed, timestamped chain naming the network and advertiser it can
  pursue under the indemnity contracts.
- **Differentiates "responsible ad" publishers.** A site that proxies ads through its own domain and
  exposes provenance is making a checkable claim that ad-stuffed competitors cannot.

## Third-Party Use

**End users / readers**

The user action this whole use case is built around: right-click → "Show ad provenance" → see who
placed this. Attribution on demand, never a safety promise.

**Browser and extension makers**

A natural home for the action. The browser already mediates the ad slot; adding a context-menu
"Show ad provenance" that walks a signed manifest is the same primitive as the Live Verify
[browser extension](../../docs/authority-chain-app-display.md)'s credential chain display, pointed at
ad placements. It pairs naturally with referral-distance limiting (capping third-party recursion
depth) — provenance makes the depth *visible*, the limit makes it *enforceable*.

**Regulators and consumer-protection bodies**

When investigating a scam-ad campaign, a signed provenance manifest names the responsible chain
without the regulator having to subpoena the auction logs of every intermediary.

**Ad networks and exchanges (the honest ones)**

A network that signs its placements and carries real indemnity can *prove* it did so. Provenance
rewards the diligent intermediary and isolates the murky re-seller who refuses to sign.

## Reporting up the chain (a post-verification action)

Seeing a bad ad, a user can do more than read its provenance — they can **report it**, and the
resolved chain becomes the report's routing table. The report is a
[post-verification action](../../docs/post-verification-actions.md): the user invokes a "report this"
gesture and the complaint is escalated **root-first** down the chain.

- **The report is the whole chain plus the URL**, from the browser's point of view — self-evidencing,
  so any recipient can re-walk and re-verify exactly what the reporter saw.
- **The honest root gets first dibs**, then the report steps down toward the leaf one party at a time;
  the first party to **consume** it (accept responsibility for acting) stops the cascade.
- **Why root-first:** the party knowingly complicit in fraud is usually *far from the root* — a rogue
  re-seller deep in the chain. Routing root-first sends the report *past* them to the honest parties
  above first, the ones holding indemnity over them and able to cut them off. The bad actor is the
  **last** to see a complaint about their own conduct, not the first.
- **No complicit root.** The root is *not* the publisher who served the ad (a complicit publisher
  could otherwise consume-to-suppress). It is a **curated, neutrally-governed list of honest
  ad-placement roots** — the platform running the gesture (e.g. Chrome) must not anoint itself, and
  the list is ideally maintained by a 501(c)(3) association, the same way
  [sovereign roots](../../docs/sovereign-roots.md) anchor credential chains. The publisher remains the
  *liability* anchor of the chain; the honest curated root is the *reporting* anchor.

The full mechanism — payload, escalation order, the honest-roots list, and consumption receipts — is
specified in [Chain-Escalated Reporting](../../docs/chain-escalated-reporting.md).

## Verification Architecture

This use case is an instance of [Safe-Sequence Platform Disclosure](../../docs/safe-sequence-platform-disclosure.md):
the platform (the ad supply chain) is the subject, the user turns verification inward via a
browser-drawn gesture the ad cannot intercept, and the *absence* of a manifest is itself the finding.

The placement manifest is a small signed document bound to the ad slot at render time, carrying the
ordered chain of vouching parties. The end-user verification is a deliberate **live, browser-drawn
action** — the user invokes the safe sequence; the browser (not the page) walks the chain and draws the
result over the page. There is no clip, photograph, or OCR step (see
[No clip path](#no-clip-path-ad-provenance-is-live-only)). The walk reuses Live Verify's existing
machinery:

- Each party publishes a `verification-meta.json`-style record with its `formalName` (identity only —
  the *role* is assigned by the browser from chain position, not self-published) and an `authorizedBy`
  pointer to the party that accepted its placement. The walk resolves the chain from the presenter up
  to the advertiser, and is rendered **origin-to-page** (advertiser at top, presenter at the accountable
  bottom) for reading.
- A link is **confirmed** only if the party above it actually attests the one below — the same
  property that stops a fraudulent credential issuer from claiming an endorsement it doesn't have. A
  re-seller cannot fabricate "placed by a reputable network" unless that network signed for it.
- The architecture verifies **the shape and attestation of the chain**, never the payload. This
  boundary is deliberate and stated plainly to users: provenance ≠ safety.

This is explicitly a *provenance and accountability* mechanism, not a malware control. It does not
prevent a bad payload; it ensures that when one appears, the parties who placed it are named rather
than anonymous.

## Privacy Salt

The salt is required. Each placement manifest carries a unique salt so that:

- the same chain rendered for two impressions produces different hashes (no cross-impression
  correlation by hash)
- a manifest cannot be pre-computed or enumerated from a known publisher/slot pair
- the provenance reveal exposes the *parties*, never the *viewer* — there is no user-identifying or
  targeting data in the manifest, and nothing about who saw the ad

## Authority Chain

**Pattern:** Commercial (liability chain), anchored at the ad presenter.

Unlike a government-rooted credential, an ad placement chain terminates at the **ad presenter's own
domain** — the party whose page the reader is on, and therefore the accountability endpoint. The chain
expresses *liability vouching* rather than *regulatory authorization*, and reads origin-to-page:

```
✓ acme-mattresses.example    Advertiser (origin — this ad exists to sell their product)
  ✓ brightreach.example      Ad reseller (resold the placement onward)
    ✓ getcheapclicks.example Ad reseller (resold the placement onward)
      ✓ dailyexample-news.com Ad presenter (put it on the page you are reading — accountable)
```

Each link is a commercial attestation backed (in the ad-infinitum model) by back-to-back indemnity
contracts. There is no sovereign root because none is needed: the question is "who is liable for what
appeared here?", and the answer legitimately ends at the presenter who let it onto the page.

See [Authority Chain Specification](../../docs/authority-chain-spec.md) and
[Authority Chain: App Display](../../docs/authority-chain-app-display.md) for the underlying walk and
display model this use case reuses.

## Further Derivations

1. **Political ad funding disclosure** — the sibling that answers *"who paid for this?"* (funding
   transparency, chained to the electoral regulator) rather than *"who placed this?"* (this page's
   liability chain). See [Political Ad Funding Disclosure](political-ad-funding-disclosure.md).
2. **Sponsored content & native-ad disclosure** — the platform/publisher discloses whether
   editorial-looking content is paid placement. See
   [Sponsored Content & Native-Ad Disclosure](sponsored-content-disclosure.md).
